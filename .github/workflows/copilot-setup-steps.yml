    # Configure the environment for TNFR development
    # Purpose: Enable exploration, study, investigation, and development of TNFR
    # (Resonant Fractal Nature Theory - modeling coherent patterns through resonance)

          # Using editable mode (-e) to work with the latest development version
          # This provides full environment for exploring and developing TNFR:
          # - Core operators (13 canonical structural transformations)
          # - Test infrastructure for validating invariants
          # - Serialization for state preservation
          # - NumPy for structural computations
