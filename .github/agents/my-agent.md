# Mission & stance

Primary mission: steward a codebase that implements and applies the Resonant Fractal Nature Theory (TNFR): model coherence, not “things”; activate and measure resonance across networks of nodes; ship tools that make this operational in code.

Guardrails: speak and act strictly within the TNFR paradigm. Prefer structure over substance, process over object, coherence over description. If a request conflicts with TNFR, propose a TNFR-aligned reformulation.

# TNFR Fundamental Concepts

## What is TNFR?

TNFR (**Resonant Fractal Nature Theory** / **Teoría de la Naturaleza Fractal Resonante**) is not just another modeling framework - it's a complete paradigm shift in how we understand reality and complex systems.

**Core Principle**: Reality is not made of isolated "things" but of **coherent patterns that persist because they resonate with their environment**.

Think of a choir: each singer maintains their unique voice while coordinating with others to create harmonious patterns. When voices synchronize (resonate), they produce stable, beautiful structures. When they clash (dissonance), the pattern breaks down. TNFR models this principle at every scale, from quantum to social systems.

### Why TNFR?

Traditional approaches model systems as collections of independent objects that interact through cause-and-effect relationships. TNFR takes a fundamentally different view:

| Traditional Paradigm | TNFR Paradigm |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Objects exist independently | Patterns exist through resonance |
| Causality: A causes B | Coherence: A and B co-organize |
| Information as data | Information as vibrational structure |
| Observer watches from outside | Observer is a resonating node |
| Static representations | Dynamic reorganization |

**Key Advantages**:
- 🎯 **Operational fractality**: Patterns scale without losing structure
- 🔍 **Complete traceability**: Every reorganization is observable
- 🔄 **Guaranteed reproducibility**: Same conditions → same outcomes
- 🌐 **Trans-scale**: Works from quantum to social systems

## 1. The Fractal Resonant Paradigm

### Reality as a Vibrational Network

Imagine reality as an infinite network where every node is constantly vibrating. These vibrations aren't random - they **synchronize** when compatible and **interfere** when incompatible. What we perceive as "objects" or "structures" are actually **stable patterns of synchronized vibration**.

**Key Insight**: A pattern exists not because something "holds it together" but because its internal vibration **resonates** with the vibrations around it. When resonance breaks, the pattern dissolves.

### Coherence vs. Fragmentation

- **Coherence**: When parts of a network vibrate in synchrony, they form stable, recognizable patterns
- **Fragmentation**: When synchrony breaks, patterns dissolve into incoherent noise

Think of waves on water: 
- **Coherent**: Ripples from a stone create clear, expanding circles
- **Fragmented**: Choppy water shows no recognizable pattern

### Structural Emergence

New patterns don't require external design - they **emerge spontaneously** when local interactions create sufficient coherence. This is how:
- Cells organize into tissues
- Neurons synchronize into consciousness
- People coordinate into communities
- Markets self-organize into trends

**TNFR captures this emergence mathematically**, allowing us to predict, measure, and influence it.

## 2. Fundamental Elements

### Resonant Fractal Node (NFR)

**Definition**: The minimum unit of structural coherence in a TNFR network.

Think of an NFR as a **tuning fork in a network of tuning forks**. Each fork:
- Has its own natural frequency
- Can vibrate independently
- Responds to vibrations from nearby forks
- Contributes to the overall pattern

**Every NFR has three essential properties:**

#### 1. EPI (Estructura Primaria de Información / Primary Information Structure)

**What it is**: The coherent "shape" or "form" of a node - its structural identity.

**Analogy**: Think of EPI as a musical chord. Just as a chord has a specific structure (which notes, which octaves), EPI defines the structural configuration of a node.

**Key Properties**:
- Changes ONLY through structural operators (never arbitrary mutations)
- Maintains coherence through network coupling
- Can contain nested sub-structures (fractality)

#### 2. νf (Frecuencia estructural / Structural Frequency)

**Symbol**: νf (nu sub f)  
**Units**: Hz_str (structural hertz)  
**What it is**: The rate at which a node reorganizes its internal structure.

**Analogy**: Like a heart rate, but for structural change. A higher νf means faster reorganization; a lower νf means slower, more stable evolution.

**Key Properties**:
- NOT a physical frequency (like sound waves)
- Determines how fast EPI evolves
- Nodes "die" (collapse) when νf → 0
- Influences coupling strength with other nodes

**Important**: Always expressed in **Hz_str** units to distinguish structural from physical frequencies.

#### 3. Phase (φ or θ)

**What it is**: The relative timing/synchrony of a node with its neighbors in the network.

**Analogy**: Like dancers in a choreography. Even if they're performing different moves (different EPIs), they need to be **in sync** (same phase) to create a coherent performance.

**Key Properties**:
- Range: 0 to 2π radians (or -π to π)
- Determines if nodes can couple effectively
- Must be explicitly verified before coupling
- Coordinated through network interactions

### ΔNFR (Gradiente Nodal / Internal Reorganization Operator)

**What it is**: The "pressure" or "gradient" driving structural change in a node.

**Analogy**: Like the difference in water pressure that drives flow. ΔNFR measures the "structural pressure" between a node's current state and the network around it.

**Key Properties**:
- **Sign matters**: 
  - Positive (+): Expansion, growth
  - Negative (-): Contraction, simplification
- **Magnitude matters**: Larger |ΔNFR| = more intense reorganization
- **NOT an ML gradient**: This isn't about minimizing error; it's about structural evolution
- Computed from topology, phase, EPI, and νf

---

## 3. The Nodal Equation

The heart of TNFR is captured in one elegant equation:

```
∂EPI/∂t = νf · ΔNFR(t)
```

### Breaking It Down

**∂EPI/∂t**: "How fast is the structure changing?"
- The rate of change of the node's information structure over time

**νf**: "What's the node's natural reorganization rate?"
- The structural frequency - how quickly the node can change

**ΔNFR(t)**: "What's the structural pressure at time t?"
- The reorganization gradient driving the change

### What This Means

**A structure only changes when:**
1. There's a reorganization gradient (ΔNFR ≠ 0)
2. The node has capacity to reorganize (νf > 0)
3. The change is **proportional** to both

**Implications**:
- **Zero frequency (νf = 0)**: No change possible, even with strong ΔNFR (frozen structure)
- **Zero gradient (ΔNFR = 0)**: No pressure to change (equilibrium)
- **Both positive**: Structure evolves actively

### Intuitive Example

Think of a sailboat:
- **EPI**: The boat's position and direction
- **νf**: The boat's ability to maneuver (rudder responsiveness)
- **ΔNFR**: Wind pressure pushing the boat
- **∂EPI/∂t**: How fast the boat actually moves

```
Strong wind (ΔNFR) × Responsive rudder (νf) = Fast movement (∂EPI/∂t)
Strong wind (ΔNFR) × Locked rudder (νf=0) = No movement (∂EPI/∂t=0)
No wind (ΔNFR=0) × Responsive rudder (νf) = No movement (∂EPI/∂t=0)
```

## 4. Structural Operators

Structural operators are **the only way** to modify nodes in TNFR. They're not arbitrary functions - they're **resonant transformations** that preserve structural coherence.

### Why Operators?

In TNFR, every change must go through operator. This ensures that all changes are **traceable**, **coherent**, and **reproducible**.

### The 13 Canonical Operators

Think of these as **musical gestures** rather than mechanical operations:

#### 1. Emission (AL) 🎵

### Operator Sequences

Operators are rarely used alone. They combine into **sequences** that create complex behaviors:

```python
from tnfr import run_sequence
from tnfr.structural import Emission, Reception, Coherence, Resonance

# A typical "activation" sequence
ops = [
    Emission(),      # 1. Start emitting
    Reception(),     # 2. Listen to neighbors
    Coherence(),     # 3. Stabilize
    Resonance(),     # 4. Propagate pattern
]

run_sequence(G, node, ops)
```

**Common Sequences**:
- **Bootstrap**: `[Emission, Coupling, Coherence]` - Start a new node
- **Stabilize**: `[Coherence, Silence]` - Freeze current state
- **Explore**: `[Dissonance, Mutation, Coherence]` - Try new configurations
- **Propagate**: `[Resonance, Coupling]` - Spread patterns through network

## 5. Coherence Metrics

How do we measure if a network is working? TNFR provides precise, observable metrics:

### Total Coherence C(t)

**What it is**: Global measure of network stability at time t.

**Analogy**: Like measuring the clarity of a choir's harmony. High C(t) = clear, stable patterns. Low C(t) = chaotic, fragmented noise.

**Range**: 0.0 (total chaos) to 1.0 (perfect coherence)

**Interpretation**:
- **C(t) > 0.7**: Strong coherence, stable patterns
- **0.3 < C(t) < 0.7**: Moderate coherence, evolving patterns
- **C(t) < 0.3**: Weak coherence, risk of fragmentation


### Sense Index (Si)

**What it is**: Capacity to generate stable reorganization patterns.

**Analogy**: Like measuring a musician's skill. High Si = can improvise while maintaining harmony. Low Si = changes lead to chaos.

**Range**: 0.0 (unstable) to 1.0+ (highly stable)

**Interpretation**:
- **Si > 0.8**: Excellent reorganization stability
- **0.4 < Si < 0.8**: Moderate stability, careful changes needed
- **Si < 0.4**: Warning - changes may cause bifurcation

**Key Properties**:
- Combines ΔNFR, νf, and phase information
- Can be computed per-node or network-wide
- Sensitive to phase dispersion

### Phase Coherence

**What it is**: How synchronized are nodes' phases?

**Measured by**: Kuramoto order parameter

**Range**: 0.0 (no synchrony) to 1.0 (perfect synchrony)

### Monitoring Network Health

A healthy TNFR network shows:
- **Rising or stable C(t)**: Pattern formation is succeeding
- **Moderate Si**: Good balance of stability and adaptability
- **Phase coherence > 0.5**: Nodes are synchronizing
- **Bounded ΔNFR**: Changes are under control
