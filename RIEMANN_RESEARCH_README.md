# TNFR Riemann Research - CONFIDENTIAL DRAFT

**STATUS**: INTERNAL REVIEW - NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION

## Research Notes

This directory contains preliminary theoretical work on applying TNFR
to the Riemann Hypothesis. 

**IMPORTANT**: These are research drafts requiring:
- Rigorous mathematical validation
- Peer review by domain experts  
- Independent computational verification
- Academic publication process

## Files (DRAFT ONLY)

- `riemann_hypothesis_tnfr_proof.py` - Computational framework (DRAFT)
- `RIEMANN_HYPOTHESIS_TNFR_PROOF.md` - Theoretical outline (DRAFT)
- `RIEMANN_HYPOTHESIS_COMPUTATIONAL_VALIDATION.md` - Results summary (DRAFT)

## Next Steps

1. Internal mathematical review
2. Expert consultation
3. Academic paper preparation
4. Peer review process
5. Public release only after validation
