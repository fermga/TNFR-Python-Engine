# TNFR Examples

128 runnable examples organized by theme. Every example derives from the
nodal equation `∂EPI/∂t = νf · ΔNFR(t)`, the 13 canonical operators, grammar
U1–U6, and the structural field tetrad `(Φ_s, |∇φ|, K_φ, ξ_C)`.

Each file keeps a **stable global number** as its identifier (the number does
not change when an example moves); the **folder gives the theme**. Run any
example directly, e.g.:

```bash
python examples/01_foundations/01_hello_world.py
python examples/09_millennium/109_p_vs_np_coherence_synthesis.py
```

`tnfr` resolves from the editable install (`pip install -e .`), so examples run
from any location.

- `112` structure predicts the coherence flow · `113` overdamped projection bridge · `114` substrate conserved quantities · `unified_fields_showcase.py`
- `117` emergent geometry on the residue graph (Paley factorization, honest: diffusion spectrum carries the factor cosets, symplectic substrate is blind; unifies factorization-lab ↔ emergent geometry)
- `118` where the emergent operator diverges from the classical Laplacian (residue graphs are regular Cayley → identical; on irregular graphs L_rw IS the Shi–Malik degree-aware Ncut → more balanced cuts)
- `119` the phase sector — directed residue operator (n≡3 mod4 → Paley tournament → complex spectrum; "3 distinct eigenvalues ⟺ odd prime" 58/58, resolves prime powers, phase encodes √n; extends Reading B to all odd primes, still e–π/Fix(G)^⊥ bounded)
- `120` the symmetry wall (vertex-transitivity of the residue Cayley digraph confines arithmetic to the spectrum; double dissociation — spectrum sees the QR arithmetic, per-node symplectic substrate is blind; same Fix(G)^⊥ wall as the paused Riemann program, explained not crossed)
- `121` can a canonical symmetry-break cross the wall? (B2-P2 lever, measured NEGATIVE: the nodal equation has no per-node weight slot; structure-derived νf is uniform on the vertex-transitive graph; arithmetic-injected νf is circular echo (shuffled control identical) — confirms the analytical B0★-β-P2 closure at the NT level)
- `122` factorization in the phase sector (the complex directed spectrum completes example 117's partial factor-coset recovery: the factor coset is a CRT Fourier mode (eigenvector of both operators); real symmetric sector 8/10 (misses 51, 91 via degenerate eigenpairs), complex directed sector 10/10 (Gauss-sum eigenvalues isolate the mode); re-expresses CRT period structure, O(√n) scan, no speedup)
- `123` the symmetry-sector decomposition (CAPSTONE: L_rw is equivariant under Aut(G), so by Schur it block-diagonalizes into Fix(G)⊕Fix(G)^⊥ with dim Fix(G)=#orbits; per-node substrate lives in Fix(G) (orbit-constant, ex-120 blindness is the vertex-transitive corollary), discriminating spectrum in Fix(G)^⊥; measured across 5 symmetry groups; the single structure behind the whole 117–122 arc and the Riemann residual)
- `124` the emergent metric is fractal-consistent (lines B+D: the canonical operator's natural metric is the effective resistance R_eff, not shortest-path, counting all parallel paths; R_eff is the unique metric consistent under the fractal node↔subgraph collapse = the exact Kron/Schur reduction of the canonical Laplacian (~1e-15); THOL currently spawns sub-EPIs as topologically isolated nodes, so conductive fractality is latent in the operator — answers "is every node also a graph?")
- `125` a node IS the emergent substrate, not a graph (the deep reading of fractality: "node as graph" (124) is the scalar transport shadow = the Fix(G)^⊥ combinatorial channel; the node's true interior is the 4D symplectic phase-space / Poincaré-sphere object = the Fix(G) geometric channel of 123. MEASURED: fixing topology freezes the Laplacian spectrum and R_eff while the substrate polarization and H_sub move — the graph picture is blind to the substrate depth; the real fractality is node↔network substrate self-similarity, not node↔subgraph)
- `126` the two layers of emergent geometry (crystallizes the node=substrate optic: BASE layer (topology — L_rw, λ₂, R_eff, Kron; state-independent) + FIBER layer (state — the per-node symplectic substrate; state-dependent), bridged by the nodal equation (ΔNFR_epi=−L_rw·EPI exactly). The reorganization map: arithmetic was a BASE property (so the fiber was blind), the 13 operators act on the FIBER (line E), λ₂ is the base→fiber coupling clock (line C))
- `127` is the base emergent-TNFR or imposed graph theory? (the doctrinal check on 126's "spectral graph theory": MEASURED — (M1) the operator is TNFR-derived, ΔNFR=−L_rw·EPI exactly but NOT −L_comb·EPI (the nodal neighbour-MEAN forces the degree-normalized L_rw, not the generic combinatorial Laplacian); (M2) no free parameters; (M3) the topology itself can EMERGE from the EPI substrate via the canonical REMESH _mst_edges_from_epi. Verdict: the base is NOT imposed graph theory — only the initial connectivity is a boundary condition, the operator is canonical and the topology is substrate-regenerable)
- `128` the base co-emerges with the substrate (the paradigm-faithful deepening of 127's M3: closes the loop topology→(nodal eq)→substrate→(REMESH MST)→topology and reaches a SELF-CONSISTENT fixed point T=MST(EPI(T)) (Jaccard 1.0). The imposed initial topology is largely washed out (fixed point = a substrate-derived spanning tree, 10–24% survives); the fixed point is NOT unique (different initial topologies → different co-emergent attractors, Jaccard 0.37–0.73), so the initial connectivity is a basin-selecting boundary condition. Both base AND fiber co-emerge from the nodal equation — the faithful footing for lines C and E)
- `129` the spectral gap is the base→fiber coupling clock (line C: λ₂ is a BASE quantity but the CLOCK of the base→fiber coupling, with four canonical faces — (M1) relaxation rate νf·λ₂, (M2) Cheeger bottleneck h²/2≤λ₂≤2h via the Fiedler cut, (M3) instability threshold r_c=νf·λ₂ = the spectral form of grammar U2, (M4) the co-emergent tree of ex 128 has the smallest gap = the slowest clock; standard spectral graph theory re-expressed, Cheeger proxy is the Fiedler cut)
- `130` the operators act on the fiber (line E, ARC CLOSER: the 13 canonical operators act on the symplectic substrate, and the dual-lever (ex 37) predicts which conserved-charge SECTOR each breaks — pure ΔNFR destabilizers (OZ/THOL/ZHIR/NAV)+NUL break ONLY the potential sector (|dE_geo|=0 exact), UM collapses the geometric sector Ψ, IL touches both (aligns phase current), AL/EN/RA/SHA/VAL/REMESH preserve all charges. The operator classification IS the substrate's conserved-charge sector map — operator algebra and emergent geometry are one structure)
- `131` the co-emergent loop always converges (a new direction opened by the arc: the closed base⊗fiber loop topology→(nodal eq)→substrate→(canonical REMESH)→topology, run freely with every canonical mode (mst/knn/community), CONVERGES to a fixed point — never cycles, never diverges (36/36 mst, 34/36 knn, 0 cycles/divergences). This is grammar U2 (convergence/boundedness) lifted from the field to the full base⊗fiber system; honest caveats: MST convergence is trivial, community collapses onto EPI communities, the U2 link is an observed inheritance not a derivation)
- `132` geometric phase / holonomy on the substrate (the per-node substrate doublet ζ=(K_φ+i·J_φ, Φ_s+i·J_ΔNFR) is a Poincaré-sphere point (ex 106); the geometric phase accumulated around a loop of substrate states equals +½ the enclosed solid angle — the BARGMANN INVARIANT arg(⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩⟨ψ₂|ψ₃⟩⟨ψ₃|ψ₁⟩)=½·Ω, an EXACT CP¹ identity (M1, 7/7 to ~1e-17), gauge-invariant hence genuinely GEOMETRIC (M2, invariant under ψ→e^{iα}ψ per node), realized as the closed-loop holonomy (M3, 4/4 exact). HONEST SCOPE: this is the Pancharatnam phase of CLASSICAL polarization optics (Pancharatnam 1956, empirically established) and an exact provable identity — NOT a quantum Berry phase, NOT a qubit (the substrate is a classical wave polarization texture, product state, no entanglement); emerges from the canonical substrate, verifies the identity, not new mathematics, closes no open problem)
- `133` topological defects of the emergent field Ψ (the canonical complex field Ψ=K_φ+i·J_φ carries phase VORTICES — the winding of arg Ψ around a face, w=(1/2π)∮d(arg Ψ), is an EXACT integer (M1, degree of S¹→S¹, ~3e-16; 20 vortices/20 antivortices/60 defect-free on a 10×10 torus); on the TORUS the total charge is exactly 0 (M2, Poincaré–Hopf, Euler χ=0 — defects come in vortex-antivortex PAIRS, #vortices=#antivortices, 4/4 seeds); the net charge is conserved exactly under the canonical step() (M3, max|net|=0, defects move/annihilate only in pairs — HONEST: the count is NOT monotone, the phase dynamics moves defects but does not cleanly anneal them, no coarsening); the tensor-suite 𝒬=|∇φ|·J_φ−K_φ·J_ΔNFR is a CONTINUOUS density, NOT the integer winding (M4, ratio ~1.0 — 𝒬 is blind to the defects despite the name). HONEST SCOPE: the winding number is an exact topological identity and phase vortices are the empirically-established defects of the XY model/superfluids/liquid crystals; emerges from the canonical Ψ field, not new mathematics, closes no open problem)
- `134` spectral dimension of the emergent diffusion / heat kernel as the EPI Green's function (the heat kernel e^{-tL} of the canonical structural-diffusion operator IS the evolution operator of the EPI channel dEPI/dt=−ν_f·L_rw·EPI — M1: heat trace Z(t)=Σe^{−λ_k t} runs n→1, and e^{−tL}u₀ reproduces the explicitly-integrated nodal diffusion to ~3e-5; the return probability p(t)=Z(t)/n~t^{−d_s/2} defines the SPECTRAL DIMENSION d_s — M2: recovers the lattice dimension (ring 1.00, 2D torus 2.2, 3D torus 3.4, with honest finite-size convergence d_s→2 as L grows 2.32→2.13); M3: structural fingerprint of non-lattice topologies — spanning tree quasi-1D (1.25), adding Watts-Strogatz shortcuts to a ring raises d_s monotonically 1.01→2.69, the complete graph is mean-field (degenerate spectrum, NO finite d_s). HONEST SCOPE: the spectral dimension is a standard spectral-geometry/anomalous-diffusion observable (Alexander–Orbach fracton dimension), asymptotic hence finite-size biased; the heat-kernel=EPI-evolution identity is the exact canonical anchor; re-expresses established spectral geometry in the emergent transport layer, not new mathematics, closes no open problem)
- `135` the emergent arrow of time / structural H-theorem of the EPI diffusion channel (the EPI channel of the nodal equation is the diffusion dEPI/dt=−ν_f·L_rw·EPI, which is IRREVERSIBLE — M1: the Dirichlet energy F=½Σ A_ij(EPI_i−EPI_j)², which EQUALS the total squared canonical structural Fick current (structural_current, |diff|=0), decreases MONOTONICALLY to 0 (dF/dt≤0 exact on a 400-step grid) — the structural H-theorem, F a Lyapunov functional; M2: the random-walk distribution p_t=e^{−tL_rw}δ has relative entropy D(p_t‖π) DECREASING monotone to 0 (rigorous H-functional any graph), and on a regular ring the Shannon entropy S(p_t) INCREASES monotone to log n — the second law; M3: the arrow of time is structural — forward diffusion smooths (F→0) while time-reversed anti-diffusion dEPI/dt=+ν_f·L_rw·EPI is ILL-POSED (F diverges ~e^{2ν_f·λ_max·t}, 158→4.7e8), only forward is well-posed because every λ_k≥0. HONEST SCOPE: the H-theorem/entropy increase for diffusion is exact and provable (Lyapunov functionals of the heat semigroup), and the arrow of time/2nd law is empirically ironclad (Clausius, Boltzmann); re-expresses the irreversibility of the EPI diffusion channel (ex 99/134) in thermodynamic language; distinct from the tetrad Lyapunov energy (conservation.py) and the Lindblad/Von Neumann entropy (dissipative_conservation.py); not new mathematics, closes no open problem)
- `136` the heat-kernel coefficients / hearing the network's geometry (the discrete Minakshisundaram–Pleijel expansion — complementary to 134's long-time reading, this reads the SHORT-time expansion Z(t)=Tr(e^{−tL})=Σ_k(−t)^k/k!·Tr(L^k) of the canonical Kirchhoff operator L=D−A (= current_divergence, anchor |L·EPI−div(J)|=3e-15). M1: the Taylor coefficients ARE the spectral moments Tr(L^k)=Σλ^k, verified two ways to machine precision; M2: the moments are weighted closed-walk counts that HEAR the geometry — Tr(L^0)=n nodes (volume), Tr(L^1)=2m edges (boundary), Tr(L^2)=2m+Σd², and via the canonical coupling W=A: Tr(A^3)=6·#triangles (triangles=curvature, verified vs networkx); M3: "can one hear the shape of a drum?" — NO (Kac 1966): a cospectral non-isomorphic pair on 6 nodes has IDENTICAL Tr(L^k) (all k) yet DIFFERENT triangle counts (0 vs 1) and degree sequences ([1,2,2,3,3,3] vs [2,2,2,2,2,4]) that conspire to the same moments. HONEST SCOPE: standard spectral graph theory (heat-kernel coefficients=closed walks, the celebrated Weyl law/Kac drum problem), exact and provable; complements 134; not new mathematics, closes no open problem)
- `137` the synchronization transition / Kuramoto criticality from the canonical phase channel (changes register from the diffusion arc to the PHASE channel: the phase component of dNFR pulls each node toward the CIRCULAR MEAN of its neighbours (g_phase=−angle_diff(θ_i,θ̄)/π) — a Kuramoto-type coupling. With heterogeneous structural frequencies ν_f the phase dynamics dθ_i/dt=ν_f_i+K·angle_diff(θ̄_neighbours,θ_i) undergoes the KURAMOTO SYNCHRONIZATION TRANSITION. M1: order parameter R=|⟨e^{iθ}⟩| (canonical kuramoto_order) rises from ~0 (incoherent drift) to ~1 (collective lock) — 2nd-order transition (coupling verified == canonical phase channel to machine precision via neighbor_phase_mean_list); M2: the threshold K_c (where R first >½) grows LINEARLY with the ν_f dispersion σ (K_c/σ≈0.90 const over 6 seeds) — frequency disorder vs coupling order; M3: on a 2D torus the phase correlation C(r)=⟨cos(θ_i−θ_{i+r})⟩ decays fast below threshold (short-range) and stays high across the lattice above it (long-range order, coherence length grows = canonical ξ_C). HONEST SCOPE: the Kuramoto transition is empirically established (fireflies, neurons, Josephson arrays); the canonical coupling is the circular-mean-angle form (Kuramoto-TYPE, not the textbook sin-sum), so the measured transition and linear K_c∝σ structure are claimed, NOT the textbook mean-field constant; re-expresses a known collective transition in the canonical phase channel, not new mathematics, closes no open problem)
- `138` structure-frequency correlation reshapes synchronization (continues the phase-channel thread: ties the nodal DYNAMICS (ν_f) to the nodal STRUCTURE (degree) on a scale-free network — ν_f_i ~ degree_i — and measures how it reshapes the Kuramoto transition. M1/M2: degree-correlated ν_f DELAYS the onset (K_c 1.50→1.80, 4-seed mean) and makes it SHARPER (largest single-step jump in R 0.19→0.31) vs random ν_f of the same dispersion — the structure-dynamics correlation frustrates early sync then releases it suddenly (the approach to a first-order/explosive transition); M3: HUBS SYNCHRONIZE LAST — the per-node lock to the global phase cos(θ_i−ψ) is NEGATIVELY correlated with degree (corr(degree,lock)≈−0.30, 4 seeds), the highest-degree quintile locks least — the structure sets the dynamical sync order; M-extra: the onset delay grows with the structure-dynamics correlation (K_c 1.40→1.80 as corr(ν_f,degree) 0→1). HONEST SCOPE: this is NOT the full textbook explosive synchronization (strong 1st-order + wide hysteresis), which needs degree-WEIGHTED coupling; the canonical phase channel is degree-NORMALIZED (circular mean), so the hysteresis is weak (honest negative) — but the delay/sharpening/hub-frustration robustly emerge; the Kuramoto/explosive-sync phenomenology is empirically established (Kuramoto 1975, Gómez-Gardeñes 2011); re-expresses it in the canonical phase channel, not new mathematics, closes no open problem)

**Note on the two `77–86` series**: `05_type_hygiene/` and `06_navier_stokes/`
were two programmes developed in parallel that previously shared the numbers
77–86. The thematic folders resolve that collision; the global numbers are
preserved as stable identifiers.
