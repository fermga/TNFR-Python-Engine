  "description": "TNFR is an operational framework that models reality as coherent reorganization rather than fixed substances. Forms that persist (cells, ideas, teams, emotional states) do so because they resonate — they share structure, rhythm and phase with their environment. TNFR provides a practical grammar (structural operators) and a nodal equation to design, stabilize, transform or collapse forms in a controlled way.",
  "summary": "Design-by-coherence: use structural frequency, phase and nodal gradients to activate and stabilize forms (EPI) across scales, from personal routines to teams, products and curricula.",
  "theory": {
    "premises": [
      "What persists is coherence. Not substance but structure-in-reorganization.",
      "A form exists when its internal frequency resonates with the reorganization it requires in its networked environment.",
      "There is no privileged scale: micro and macro are levels of the same resonant web.",
      "The goal is not only to understand but to activate: TNFR intervenes by shaping form."
