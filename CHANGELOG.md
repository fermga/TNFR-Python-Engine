## [Unreleased]

### Added — the emergent pulse read-outs (the rhythm the substrate plays)

- **The pulse, surfaced at both scales.** The conservative face of the nodal
  dynamics is a *sustained vibration*; it is now a first-class read-out.
  `compute_emergent_pulse` / SDK `net.rhythm()` give the **collective** network
  pulse (resonances `ω_k = √λ_k`, fundamental, dominant beat, vibration energy);
  `compute_nodal_pulse` / SDK `net.resonance()` give the **per-NFR** pulse — every
  NFR a phase oscillator at its own `νf` and phase `φ`, coupled by *resonance*
  (`local_phase_sync` per NFR, the Kuramoto order `R`, gate `Δφ_max = π/2`). The
  collective pulse emerges as the per-NFR pulses lock (`R → 1`).
- **The pulse in motion.** `net.pulse_trajectory(steps)` evolves a copy and records
  the rhythm forming over time — `R(t)`, `C(t)`, the per-NFR local resonance —
  surfacing the **local-before-global** synchronization cascade (clusters lock
  before the global rhythm). `net.evolve(record=True)` + `net.history()` surface the
  engine's own canonical per-step series (`kuramoto_R`, `C_steps`, `phase_sync`,
  `Si_mean`).
- **Dual-face telemetry.** `compute_unified_telemetry` now carries both the
  dissipative read-out (canonical tetrad + coherence, relaxes to `ΔNFR = 0`) and the
  conservative `pulse` + `resonance` blocks (which do not saturate).

### Changed (emergent derivation — the grammar temporal windows from the pulse)

- **The U4b/U2 grammar windows are now derived, not assumed.** A destabilizer's
  `|ΔNFR|` perturbation relaxes geometrically under the discrete nodal step
  (`q = 1 − νf·dt·ρ`, with `ρ = trace(L_rw)/N = 1`, exact). Read two ways from the
  same `q`: the **relaxation time** to the coherence band `1/(π+1)` is the **U4b
  recency window** (and the `GRAMMAR` repeat-avoidance window) = **3**; the
  **geometric absorption capacity** `⌊1/(1−q)⌋` is the **U2 debt threshold** = **2**.
  New `derive_bifurcation_window_from_physics` / `derive_u2_debt_capacity_from_physics`
  (`config/physics_derivation.py`) replace the literal `3`/`2` — with **no `e`** (the
  canonical relaxation is the *discrete* geometric decay `qⁿ`, not the continuous
  exponential `e^{−νf λ t}`, which is only the `dt → 0` limit the engine never takes).
  The earlier **graduated destabilizer split** (strong = 4 / moderate = 2) was a
  heuristic the dynamics does not support and has been **dropped** — one emergent
  window for every destabilizer (the relaxation rate `ρ = trace/N = 1` is
  topology-independent, so the window is a topology-independent constant).

### Performance

- **Topology-keyed spectral cache.** `structural_eigenmodes` and `relaxation_spectrum`
  now share one memoized eigendecomposition of the symmetric normalized Laplacian,
  keyed on the graph topology (self-invalidating when nodes/edges/weights change).
  The spectrum is invariant under evolution on a fixed graph, so the O(N³) `eigh`
  runs once per topology instead of once per pulse/spectrum read-out.

### Changed (emergent derivation — every channel weight & operator gain from π)

- **Replaced the residual magic numbers on the nodal-physics paths with values
  derived from π** (the sole structural scale), per `EMERGENT_DERIVATION_PLAN.md`.
  The φ/γ/e purge had left two load-bearing weight sets **frozen at their literal
  φ/γ decimals** (`DNFR_WEIGHTS`/`SI_WEIGHTS` = `{0.737, 0.155, 0.09}` where
  `0.737 = φ/(φ+γ)`) and had replaced the operator gains with arbitrary
  "operational" decimals (`IL=0.75, OZ=2.0, SHA/NUL=0.9, VAL=1.05`). These are
  used *numerically* in every ΔNFR and Sense-Index evaluation, hence in every
  recorded result. They are now emergent:
  - **Channel-mixing weights → the coherence-band hierarchy.** Each
    structurally-active channel takes the high-coherence share `π/(π+1)` of the
    remainder: `(π/(π+1), π/(π+1)², 1/(π+1)²)` — which **normalises to exactly 1**
    (`π/(π+1) + π/(π+1)² + 1/(π+1)² = (π+1)²/(π+1)² = 1`). Ordering by structural
    primacy (phase ≻ EPI ≻ νf; topo inactive). `SI_WEIGHTS` takes the same hierarchy.
  - **Operator gains → the coherence band and the π-fraction ladder.** Pressure
    lever (ΔNFR): `IL = π/(π+1)`, `OZ = (π+1)/π` (a balanced `IL∘OZ` is **exactly
    isometric**). Capacity lever (νf, slow): the gentle π-step `δ = 1/(4π)` —
    `SHA/NUL = 1−δ`, `VAL = 1+δ`, `NUL_densification = 1/(1−δ)` (volume
    conservation). Secondary couplings on the π-fraction ladder (`1/(4π), 1/(2π),
    1/(8π)`); ZHIR θ-shift `1/π`; `NAV_eta`/`REMESH_alpha` = the unit midpoint `0.5`.
  - **Selection, feedback & adaptation → π/band (no more operational decimals on
    the coherence paths).** `SELECTOR_WEIGHTS` takes the same coherence-band
    hierarchy; the coherence triggers are the high-coherence gate `π/(π+1)`, the
    new rectified-mean level `2/π`, and the unit midpoint/quarter `0.5`/`0.25`;
    `AU_CURVATURE` is the exact midpoint `(0.9π+π)/2` of the strict K_φ gate and the
    π wrap; the phase couplings, `FEEDBACK` tolerances/rates, `OZ` noise and `THOL`
    metabolic weights are π-fractions (`1/(2π), 1/(4π), 1/(8π)`); the `get_factor`
    safety fallbacks reference the emergent constants. The selector *magnitude*
    thresholds (`dnfr_hi/lo`, `accel_hi/lo`) are honestly left **operational**
    (|ΔNFR|/∂²EPI scale, not coherence — π-flavouring them would repeat the φ/γ/e
    naming-convention error).
  - New single-source constants in `constants/canonical.py`:
    `CHANNEL_WEIGHT_PRIMARY/SECONDARY/TERTIARY`, `COHERENCE_RETENTION`,
    `DISSONANCE_AMPLIFICATION`, `COUPLING_GENTLE/MODERATE/FINE`,
    `MID_COHERENCE_THRESHOLD`. Full suite green (`2201 passed`) after each stage;
    the dynamics stay bounded (U2). **Recorded research results computed with the
    old constants still require recomputation (planned Stage 5).**
  - **Benchmark/example φ/γ/e input purge.** Fixed a broken example
    (`examples/02_physics_regimes/37_operator_tetrad_synergy.py` imported the purged
    `GAMMA`/`PHI` from `constants/canonical` → `ImportError`; examples aren't in the
    test suite so it had slipped through) — it now runs. Updated the
    `coherence_projector_sense_index` benchmark `SI_WEIGHTS` to the band hierarchy,
    removed dead `PHI/GAMMA/E` constants from `boundary_vibration`, de-refuted the
    `phase_wall` correspondence comments (its TEST-4 obstruction result — building
    `φA+γL+πL²+eK` to *prove* the four constants are insufficient — is kept), and
    replaced ~27 stale "(φ,γ,π,e) remain the assumed substrate" claims with "π"
    across 14 benchmark files. The legitimate emergent-*object* studies are kept
    (the Kuramoto φ-as-Fibonacci-limit, the golden-angle sphere sampling, Euler
    products, the Γ chirality matrix, tetrahedral symmetry groups).
  - **Recomputation & robustness (the canonical-emergence proof).** Re-running the
    paradigm results under the emergent engine changed **no headline verdict** —
    because each is *structural*, not an artifact of the magic numbers: primality
    (`ΔNFR=0`), Riemann σ_c/GUE and exact S_n equivariance (`‖[L, P_σ⊗P_τ]‖ = 0`),
    Navier–Stokes (a **pseudo-spectral** solver that never reads the operator
    gains), conservation, the tetrad relations (`K_φ = L_rw·φ`, `ξ_C ∝ 1/√λ₂`), and
    Yang–Mills U6 confinement all derive from the graph Laplacian, the spectral gap,
    S_n symmetry, or unit arithmetic. Only the dynamic *trajectories* (C(t)/Si
    curves, network-optimization outcomes) shift, with their qualitative attractors
    invariant. The φ/γ/e and arbitrary operational decimals were therefore **never
    load-bearing**: the refactor both cleans the foundation and *proves* the results
    are genuinely emergent. See `EMERGENT_DERIVATION_PLAN.md` §7.

### Changed (documentation aligned to emergent π-derived canonicity)

- **Promoted the documented thresholds to their genuinely-emergent π-derived
  values** across `AGENTS.md` (+ the `.github/agents/my-agent.md` mirror),
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `theory/`, `docs/grammar/`, examples, and
  code docstrings: the Φ_s confinement bound is **π-derived** — drift
  `Δ Φ_s < π/2 ≈ 1.571` (half phase-wrap) and per-node `|Φ_s| < π/4 ≈ 0.785`
  (quarter phase-wrap) — replacing the old φ ≈ 1.618 / empirical 0.7711 framing;
  the strong-coherence cut is the emergent band gate `π/(π+1) ≈ 0.7585`
  (replacing the frozen `(e·φ)/(π+e) ≈ 0.7506`). Corrected a propagated arithmetic
  error: `π/(π+1)` is **0.7585**, not 0.7616 (it must complement `1/(π+1)=0.2415`).
  The SDK `COHERENCE_STRONG` now aliases the emergent `HIGH_COHERENCE_THRESHOLD`
  (π/(π+1)); `MIN_BUSINESS_COHERENCE` (0.75) stays the separate operational
  business-health knob.
- **Removed `theory/SPIRAL_ATTRACTORS_AND_LOGARITHMIC_DYNAMICS.md` and its demo
  (`examples/02_physics_regimes/32_spiral_attractors_demo.py`)** — a false
  φ/γ/e-era claim ("golden ratio as dynamical attractor", "fourth constant γ").
  The demo imported the purged φ/γ/e constants (so it could not run, making the
  document's "Validated" status false) and the golden-attractor check was circular
  (it set `b = 2·ln(φ)/π` by hand, then "verified" quarter-turn ratios = φ). Only
  the trivial, non-distinctive kernel (log spirals appear in a rotation + growth
  regime, with a free `b = νf·k/ω`) was true; φ is not selected by the dynamics.
  References cleaned from `theory/README.md`, `FUNDAMENTAL_THEORY.md`, and
  `examples/README.md`.
- **Completed a full `theory/` document audit** (every `theory/*.md`) for residual
  φ/γ/e false claims, with **no further deletions needed** — SPIRAL_ATTRACTORS was
  the only doc with a false *thesis*; the rest are genuinely emergent and carried
  only scattered stale refs (now fixed). The most significant correction purges the
  refuted **"Universal Tetrahedral Correspondence"** (the φ↔Φ_s, γ↔|∇φ|, π↔K_φ,
  e↔ξ_C mapping) from `TNFR_RIEMANN_RESEARCH_NOTES.md` (20 references) — the explicit
  mapping becomes the minimal **structural-field tetrad** (only π is structural), the
  three inter-prime coupling kernels are relabeled *exploratory, not canonical*, and
  the stale `DNFR_/SI_/SELECTOR_WEIGHTS` derivation claims/anchors are corrected to
  the operational `defaults_core.py` values. Operator-gain tables across
  `STRUCTURAL_OPERATORS`, `STRUCTURAL_CONSERVATION_THEOREM`,
  `STRUCTURAL_STABILITY_AND_DYNAMICS`, `TNFR_VARIATIONAL_PRINCIPLE`,
  `TNFR_YANG_MILLS_RESEARCH_NOTES` (+ 2 `yang_mills/structural_gap.py` docstrings),
  `CATALOG_TYPE_HYGIENE_PROGRAMME`, and `TNFR_NUMBER_THEORY` were updated from frozen
  φ/γ/e formulas (e.g. IL `φ/(φ+γ)≈0.737`→`0.75`, OZ `φ/γ≈2.803`→`2.0`, NUL
  densification `2.803`→`1/λ≈1.111`, U6 `Δ Φ_s < φ`→`π/2`, `|∇φ|` heuristic
  `γ/π`→`π/16`) to the operational engine values. No engine code changed (the code
  was already purged; only doc text and 2 cosmetic docstrings).

### Changed (operational-knob relocation — `canonical.py` is now pure physics)

- **Split the ~150 operational engine-tuning knobs out of
  `constants/canonical.py` into a new dedicated module
  `constants/operational.py`** (explicitly *engine tuning, NOT TNFR physics*).
  `canonical.py` now holds **89 numeric constants**, all genuine structural /
  physics quantities (π phase-wrap bounds, spectral-gap ξ_C, the coherence band,
  operator gains, tetrad / phase / νf / EPI / KL / DT scales); the **150** moved
  knobs (caches, FFT tuning, optimization speedup/performance estimates,
  pattern-discovery confidence, integration baselines, operator scoring weights)
  live in `operational.py`. The new module imports only `PI` from canonical
  (one-way dependency; canonical never imports operational), and a parallel
  `engines/constants/operational.py` star-shim mirrors the existing `canonical`
  shim. The `canonical ∪ operational` union reproduces the pre-split constant set
  **exactly** (verified name→value, 0 leaks / 0 drift). 26 consumer modules were
  redirected; mixed importers were split to preserve their structural imports.

### Removed (φ/γ/e purge — only π remains a genuine structural scale)

- **Removed the obsolete constants φ (golden ratio), γ (Euler–Mascheroni), and
  e (Napier) from the engine.** They are no longer canonical constants, appear in
  no calculation, weight, threshold, or comment, and the "(φ,γ,π,e) notational
  vertex / four-constants / assumed-substrate" framing is retired. **Only π is a
  genuine structural scale** (the phase-wrap bound of the phase sector:
  `|∇φ| ≤ π`, `|K_φ| < 0.9·π`); the coherence length is set by the spectral gap
  (`ξ_C ∝ 1/√λ₂`); every other parameter is derived from the nodal dynamics or is
  a free operational parameter.
- **Φ_s confinement bound is now π-derived**: per-node
  `PHI_S_VON_KOCH_THRESHOLD = π/4 ≈ 0.785` (quarter phase-wrap) and drift
  `U6_STRUCTURAL_POTENTIAL_LIMIT = π/2 ≈ 1.571` (half phase-wrap), replacing the
  empirical `0.7711` / golden-ratio (`φ ≈ 1.618`) framing.
- **Removed `derive_tetrad_threshold_values`** and the `φ/γ/e` accumulation-law
  threshold-derivation machinery (`ThresholdDerivation`). Operator gain magnitudes
  are now plain operational parameters — the theory fixes each operator's channel
  and sign via its contract, not its magnitude.
- **Re-derived the live physics constants** from π / nodal / spectral quantities,
  de-dressed the engine-configuration tier (cache, FFT, optimization, performance
  knobs) to plain operational values, and purged the `φ/γ/e` references from
  source comments, docstrings, and the documentation set (`ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.zenodo.json`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `benchmarks/README.md`, and the `theory/` + `docs/` notes).

### Changed (emergent-canon consolidation — frozen φ/γ/e values re-derived)

- **Audited every constant** for emergent grounding (see `EMERGENT_CANON_AUDIT.md`).
  The purge had left the numeric *values* frozen (e.g. `K_TOP_FALLBACK` still held
  `2.803171 = φ/γ`); those magic numbers are now re-derived or eliminated so the
  canonical base is genuinely emergent.
- **Genuine emergent derivation** — the prime-detection threshold
  `MATH_DELTA_NFR_THRESHOLD = 0.5` is the unit-gap midpoint: with unit arithmetic
  ΔNFR coefficients, `prime ⟺ ΔNFR = 0` exactly and every composite has
  `ΔNFR > 1`, so any cut in `(0, 1)` separates them.
- **π-derived**: `MAX_STRUCTURAL_FREQUENCY = 2π`, `MIN_STRUCTURAL_FREQUENCY = 1/(2π)`,
  `AU_CURVATURE_PERMISSIVE = 0.96·π`, `CRITICAL_EXPONENT = GRAD_PHI_CANONICAL_THRESHOLD = π/16`,
  `DYNAMICS_SI_HI = π/(π+1)`, the `K_TOP` clamp `1/(8π) … 1.0` and fallback `π`.
- **Removed the non-physical / vestigial** arithmetic-recalibrated trio
  (`PHI_S_THRESHOLD`, `GRAD_PHI_THRESHOLD`, and `K_PHI_THRESHOLD = 3.2275`, which
  *exceeded* the π phase-wrap bound and was therefore an unreachable no-op check).
- **Eliminated the dead domain constants** (`MEDICAL_*`, `BUSINESS_*`, `EXAMPLE_*`,
  `VIZ_*`, `CLI_*`, `THERAP_*`, `SCRIPT_*`, `TOOL_*`, `UTILS_*`) and the dead
  `CANONICAL_CONSTANTS` registry; relocated the SDK builder defaults into
  `sdk/builders.py`. The remaining ~180 operational engine knobs were rounded to
  plain ≤2-decimal values (dropping the false φ/γ/e precision). `constants/canonical.py`
  shrank from ~770 to ~565 lines.
- Reconciled inline operator gains (`operators/__init__.py`) to the canonical
  `SHA_VF_FACTOR` / `NUL_SCALE_FACTOR` / `VAL_SCALE_FACTOR`, and removed residual
  inline artifacts (`10·φ`, `e`, `4/(e+φ)`) in `bifurcation.py`, `variational.py`,
  `cycle_detection.py`, and `signatures.py`.

## [0.0.3.5] - 2026-06-24 — Tetrad correspondence audit & emergent redesign

A computational audit of the "Universal Tetrahedral Correspondence" found that
only **π** is a genuine structural scale; the four-constant correspondence
(φ↔Φ_s, γ↔|∇φ|, e↔ξ_C) is mostly an **organizing overlay**. Several thresholds
asserted as "derived" were empirical, inert (magic), or measured false. This
work corrects the claims and replaces magic thresholds with emergent,
system-measured quantities. The nodal equation, the 13 operators, and grammar
U1–U6 are unchanged.

### Corrected (canonicity claims)

- **Only π is a genuine structural scale** — the phase-wrap bound shared by BOTH
  `|∇φ|` and `K_φ` (both are means of wrapped angles, ≤ π). γ, e, φ are
  recoverable as mathematical identities but are NOT the structural scales of
  their tetrad fields. `K_φ = L_rw·φ` (the central operator on phase, corr ≈ 1);
  `ξ_C ∝ 1/√λ₂` (spectral gap, not base e).
- **`|∇φ|` bound corrected** from `γ/π ≈ 0.1837` to the phase-wrap bound `0.9π`
  in `physics/variational.py`, symmetric with `K_φ`. The measured synchronization
  onset is ≈ 0.29 and σ-dependent, NOT the constant γ/π; γ/π is retained
  elsewhere only as a heuristic early-warning level, explicitly labelled
  non-derived.
- **`derive_tetrad_threshold_values`** rows re-statused: π `geometric`; φ, γ, e
  `overlay` (recoverable identities, not structural scales).
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.zenodo.json`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `theory/README.md`,
  `docs/STRUCTURAL_FIELDS_TETRAD.md`, `constants/canonical.py`** — removed the
  "Universal Tetrahedral Correspondence foundation / 100% derived / zero
  empirical tuning / verified to machine precision" claims; replaced with the
  honest tiering (π genuine; γ/e/φ notational overlay).
- **Second audit pass (repo-wide)** — removed the remaining "Universal
  Tetrahedral Correspondence / canonical derivation / Kuramoto critical
  coupling" claims and internal contradictions across `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  (the "Mathematical Purity / 497 magic numbers eliminated / zero empirical"
  sections), `README.md`, `theory/FUNDAMENTAL_THEORY.md`, `theory/GLOSSARY.md`,
  `theory/EXTENDED_FIELDS_AND_DERIVED_QUANTITIES.md`, `AGENTS.md` (+ mirror),
  `docs/grammar/PHYSICS_VERIFICATION.md`, and the central constants modules
  (`telemetry/constants.py`, `mathematics/unified_numerical.py`,
  `config/defaults_core.py`, `physics/signatures.py`,
  `operators/grammar_telemetry.py`, `physics/emergent_chemistry.py`) plus four
  benchmarks. Exposed cosmetic "derivations" (e.g. `MIN_BUSINESS_SENSE_INDEX =
  1/φ + 0.082 ≈ 0.700`, `⌊φ×10⌋ = 16`) as calibrated/notational values.

### Changed (emergent replacement of magic thresholds)

- **`physics/phase_transition.py` fully redesigned** to emergent sampling-noise
  z-scores. The "universal critical exponent γ_c = γ/π" was **measured false**
  (the fitted exponent is protocol-dependent), and the classification noise
  floor `(γ/π)²` was **proven inert** (it sat in a two-order-of-magnitude gap;
  sweeping it changed no classification). Removed the magic constants `GAMMA_C`,
  `ORDER_PARAMETER_NOISE_FLOOR`, `CHIRALITY_THRESHOLD` and the
  `theoretical_exponent` field; added `symmetry_zscore(mean, var, n) =
  |mean|/√(Var/N)` and the single cut `Z_SIGNIFICANCE = 1` (the sampling-noise
  scale, not a tunable constant). `classify_phase(order_z, chirality_z)` now
  decides phases from statistical significance measured from the system itself.
- **Named γ/π constants relabelled** as heuristic / non-derived in
  `constants/canonical.py` (`CRITICAL_EXPONENT`, `GRAD_PHI_CANONICAL_THRESHOLD`,
  `PHASE_GRADIENT_THRESHOLD_CANONICAL`) and `mathematics/unified_numerical.py`;
  `gauge.py`, `emergent_chemistry.py`, `interactions.py` regime thresholds
  marked calibrated/heuristic, not derived.

### Notes

- **Third audit pass (repo-wide, exhaustive)** — removed the remaining
  "Universal Tetrahedral Correspondence / canonical derivation / zero empirical
  fitting" claims across the two subprojects (`primality-test/`,
  `factorization-lab/`), examples, benchmarks, the `mathematical_purity` tests
  (now check genuine bounds, not the refuted mapping), all theory docs
  (`FUNDAMENTAL_THEORY.md §4` and `GLOSSARY` renamed to "structural-field
  tetrad"), and ~40 in-code combo comments (`defaults_core.py`, `bifurcation.py`,
  `cycle_detection.py`, `number_theory.py`, etc.) now marked notational. Exposed
  the primality coefficients (ζ=φγ, η=(γ/φ)π, θ=1/φ) as combos chosen to
  approximate the original empirical values (ζ=1.0, η=0.8, θ=0.6).
- The gauge force-regime classification and emergent-chemistry excitation scale
  were flagged here for full emergent rework; that rework is now complete — see
  "Emergent redesign" below.
- Full test suite green (2196 passed) after all three passes.

### Consequences audit (computational impact, 2026-06-21)

A measure-first review of whether *calculations* (not just narrative) depended
on the refuted tetrad values. Main finding: **the significant results are
robust**, because they emerge from STRUCTURE (integer orderings, exact zeros,
relative scores) rather than the scale values (γ/π, etc.):

- **Emergent chemistry** (periodic table, magic numbers 2/10/18/36/54/86,
  octet): the aufbau filling order uses only the integers (n+l, n); the octet
  is the exact ΔNFR=0 zero — both independent of any scale coefficient. The
  `nu_excitation` (=γ/π), `nu_0`, `coherence_gap` fields were DEAD (defined,
  never consumed) and were removed; only `theta_valence` enters, as a positive
  scale (the zero is robust to its value).
- **Number-theory primality** (n prime ⟺ ΔNFR=0): each pressure term vanishes
  individually for primes (Ω−1, τ−2, σ/n−(1+1/n) are all 0), so the result is
  independent of the coefficients ζ, η, θ.
- **Gauge interaction regimes**: `dominant_regime` is decided by relative
  scores, NOT the γ/π threshold; `above_threshold` (which used γ/π) is metadata.
- **Riemann ζ-bridge buffer** γ/π: a regularisation shift whose exact value is
  immaterial. **K_φ asymptotic exponent** α≈2.76: a measured fit, unrelated.

Real consequences corrected:
- `PHASE_CURVATURE_ABS_THRESHOLD = φ×π ≈ 5.083` was a **non-physical** K_φ bound
  (|K_φ| ≤ π by phase wrap, so any check using it was a no-op); it was dead code,
  corrected to `0.9π ≈ 2.827`.
- `STRUCTURAL_STABILITY_AND_DYNAMICS.md §2.2` still described the old γ_c
  classification table; updated to the emergent z-score rule.
- Removed the dead chemistry scale parameters; fixed a residual
  `MATHEMATICAL_DYNAMICS_BASIS.md` |∇φ| claim. Full suite green (2196 passed).

### Emergent redesign (gauge regimes + chemistry excitation, 2026-06-21)

Completed the full emergent rework of the two studies whose conceptual base was
the (now-refuted) four-constant overlay. Both were rebuilt to rest on STRUCTURE
alone (measure-first; no value replaced by another magic value):

- **Gauge interaction-regime classification** (`physics/gauge.py`): removed the
  three overlay threshold constants `REGIME_DOMINANCE_THRESHOLD` (1/φ),
  `REGIME_STRONG_THRESHOLD` (γ/π, "Kuramoto critical coupling in gauge") and the
  unused `REGIME_SECONDARY_THRESHOLD` (γ/(π+γ)). The per-sector `above_threshold`
  activity flags now use a single parameter-free criterion: a sector is *active*
  when its normalised score exceeds the equipartition share `1/N_REGIMES = 0.25`
  (the maximum-entropy reference, derived from the number of gauge sectors — the
  four structural channels of the tetrad). Uniform across all four sectors; no
  overlay constant. New public symbols `N_REGIMES`, `REGIME_ACTIVITY_SHARE`
  replace the removed thresholds. `dominant_regime` (relative `max` of scores)
  is unchanged — it was already robust. Measured: the criterion always flags the
  dominant sector and additionally marks genuine co-active secondaries.
- **Emergent-chemistry valence scale** (`physics/emergent_chemistry.py`): removed
  the last free scale parameter (`theta_valence = 1/φ`) and the now-trivial
  `EmergentChemistryParameters` dataclass. `ΔNFR_chem(Z)` is now the **integer**
  structural distance of the outer shell to a closed configuration, in natural
  units (one subshell step = 1) — the exact chemical analogue of primality
  `ΔNFR(n)=0`. Noble gases (2,10,18,36,54,86) → ΔNFR=0; halogens/alkali → 1;
  oxygen → 2; carbon → 4. Magic numbers and the octet are unchanged (they always
  emerged from the integer (n+l) ordering and the exact zero).
- **Measured (chemistry):** tested whether the (n+l) filling order could emerge
  from the raw Laplacian spectrum of a concentric multi-shell ("onion") manifold.
  It does NOT — Madelung ordering reflects electron-electron screening absent
  from a free graph Laplacian. (n+l) is therefore documented honestly as an
  integer excitation-count rule (total radial+angular quanta), not a spectral
  derivation and not a constant correspondence.
- Tests updated (`test_gauge.py`: `TestRegimeActivityCriterion`, equipartition
  consistency). Full suite green (2195 passed, 2 skipped).

## [0.0.3.4] - 2026-06-17

This release consolidates the emergent-geometry program, centralizes the
operator/grammar/contract layer onto single canonical sources, opens three new
TNFR-native Millennium-problem programs, and refactors the documentation to the
current engine state. The 13-operator catalog, grammar U1–U6, and the nodal
equation are unchanged; everything below either *measures* structure the nodal
equation already contains or removes duplication. Full suite: 2043 passed, 2
skipped.

### Emergent Geometry — Symplectic Substrate (canonical)

The nodal equation generates its own geometry; the graph is only the data
substrate. The conservation laws of `physics/conservation.py` are consolidated
into an explicit emergent **symplectic phase space** that the engine measures
rather than postulates.

- **New module**: `src/tnfr/physics/symplectic_substrate.py` — phase space
  `P = ℝ^{4N}` with conjugate pairs `(K_φ, J_φ)` (geometric) and `(Φ_s, J_ΔNFR)`
  (potential); symplectic 2-form `ω` (antisymmetric, non-degenerate, closed);
  canonical Poisson brackets; `H_sub = ½Σ(K_φ²+J_φ²+Φ_s²+J_ΔNFR²)` equal to the
  energy functional exactly; Liouville `div(X_H)=0` (the 13 operators are
  symplectomorphisms).
- **Derived structure tower** (each measured to machine precision):
  Noether charges (time-translation → `H_sub`; geometric U(1) → `E_geo = ½Σ|Ψ|²`;
  potential U(1) → `E_pot`); the compatible Hermitian / flat-Kähler triple
  `(ω, J, g)` with `J = −ω` — so the `i` in `Ψ = K_φ + i·J_φ` *is* the complex
  structure the substrate induces; complete integrability (action–angle,
  Liouville–Arnold); Poincaré–Cartan integral invariants; Marsden–Weinstein
  symplectic reduction; and the hidden **U(2) polarization symmetry** whose
  SU(2) part supplies three conserved **Stokes parameters** on the per-node
  Poincaré sphere (classical wave polarization — Stokes 1852 / Poincaré 1892 —
  not isospin or qubits).
- **Threshold values derived non-circularly**: `physics/variational.py`
  `derive_tetrad_threshold_values` recovers φ (inverse-square self-similar fixed
  point), γ (harmonic-accumulation gap), e (memoryless-decay series) from each
  tetrad field's accumulation law; π remains a geometric primitive.
- **Consolidated entry point**: `verify_substrate_geometry(G)` bundles all
  certificates into a `SubstrateGeometryReport`.
- **SDK**: `Network.symplectic_substrate()` + `SymplecticReport`, in
  `TNFR.analyze()`.
- **Honest scope**: a flat, constant-coefficient linear Kähler backbone — a
  consolidation of geometry already implied by `conservation.py` +
  `variational.py`; it does not resolve any open program.
- **Demonstrations**: `examples/08_emergent_geometry/98`, `106`, `114`.

### Emergent Geometry — Structural Diffusion (transport layer)

The EPI channel of the canonical ΔNFR is the random-walk graph Laplacian
`−L_rw·EPI` (verified to residual ~1e-16), so the nodal equation is literally a
discrete diffusion equation with diffusivity `νf`. From this single identity the
engine measures, in TNFR's own variables, a tower of empirically-established
transport phenomena.

- **New module**: `src/tnfr/physics/structural_diffusion.py` — six transport
  layers: diffusion/synchronization (Fourier/Fick/Kuramoto), overdamped drift
  (`q̇ = νf·F`, Stokes/Einstein mobility — corrects the prior "Newton's second
  law" reading: the bare first-order nodal equation is overdamped, νf is mobility
  not inverse mass), discrete standing-wave modes (bounded-manifold Laplacian
  eigenmodes), structural-stability dispersion relation (`σ_k = r − νf·λ_k`, the
  spectral form of U2), random walk + effective resistance (Ohm/Kirchhoff), and
  structural flow (current, Kirchhoff continuity, Ohm).
- **Overdamped-projection bridge**: the nodal equation is the strong-damping
  limit of the substrate wave `q̈ + γq̇ + Lq = 0` with `νf = 1/γ`; the γ-dial
  spans diffusion (γ→∞) to standing waves (γ→0).
- **Honest scope**: the EPI-channel ↔ Laplacian identity is exact; the full ΔNFR
  is multi-channel; `λ_2` is purely topological and does not encode any canonical
  constant (measured negative result).
- **Demonstrations**: `examples/08_emergent_geometry/99`, `113`, `134`, `135`.

### Operator Contracts & Energy — Centralization and Emergence

- **Canonical contract layer**: new `src/tnfr/operators/operator_contracts.py` —
  the single source of truth for what each operator does to node state, anchored
  to the direct `_op_*` effect (TNFR.pdf §2.2.1). Each `OperatorContract` records
  the public English name, the `primary_channel` (one nodal-equation channel:
  EPI / νf / θ / ΔNFR), the `scale` (NODE for twelve operators, NETWORK for the
  U5 operator REMESH), and a verifiable postcondition. The proactive audit
  (`audit_operator_contracts`), the reactive integrity monitor (`POSTCONDITIONS`),
  and the introspection metadata now all derive from this spec — eliminating the
  historical drift where scattered copies disagreed (e.g. AL claiming "positive
  ΔNFR" though `_op_AL` only raises EPI; RA checked for EPI increase though it
  preserves identity; VAL/NUL checked |EPI| though they scale νf).
- **Public English names**: the structural-operator name (Emission, Reception, …)
  is canonical at the public level; the glyph code (AL, EN, …) is the internal
  symbol.
- **Energy/coherence are emergent**: the structural energy
  `E = ½Σ(Φ_s²+|∇φ|²+K_φ²+J_φ²+J_ΔNFR²)` contains no EPI or νf term (measured:
  scaling EPI or νf leaves E unchanged). The per-operator Lyapunov role in
  `physics/lyapunov.py` is therefore re-derived from the canonical grammar U2 role
  (`config.physics_derivation`), not from a hardcoded energy algebra:
  stabilisers {IL, THOL}, destabilisers {OZ, ZHIR, VAL}, the rest neutral. The
  form-channel operators (AL, EN, RA, REMESH) are energy-neutral because EPI is
  absent from E.
- **Dual-lever clarified**: the two levers are the two right-hand-side factors of
  the nodal equation — νf (capacity) and ΔNFR (pressure); operators that write
  the form EPI (the LHS) sit on neither lever.
- **Demonstrations**: `examples/08_emergent_geometry/152`,
  `examples/02_physics_regimes/115`.

### Grammar — Single Canonical Source & Formal-Language Characterization

- **Centralization**: the operator-classification sets (generators, closures,
  stabilizers, destabilizers, transformers, bifurcation triggers/handlers) are
  derived once in `config.physics_derivation` and re-exported by
  `operators/grammar_types.py`. Every grammar consumer — the U1–U6 validator,
  the secondary sequence validator, grammar_dynamics, the runtime preconditions,
  the error factory, and the operator metadata — now reads the single source.
  Parallel hardcoded copies (including a secondary validator that wrongly listed
  NUL as a U2 destabilizer) were removed and pinned by
  `tests/operators/test_grammar_canonical_consistency.py`.
- **Canonical grammar spec**: new `operators/grammar_canon.py` materializes the
  U1–U6 role table, the five-type structural typology, and the canonical glyphic
  macros (anchored to TNFR.pdf §2.3), with a self-consistency check.
- **Formal-language thread** (characterization, demos only): the grammar is a
  regular language with a 29-state minimal DFA and exact Perron–Frobenius
  capacity; the asymptotic constraint lives entirely in the bifurcation rule
  (U4b); the syntactic monoid is aperiodic so the language is star-free /
  first-order definable; nesting `THOL[...]` lifts the glyphic sub-language to
  context-free (Dyck/Catalan); the emergent operator distribution is the
  Shannon–Parry maximum-entropy equilibrium.
- **Demonstrations**: `examples/08_emergent_geometry/139`–`152`.

### Number Theory & the Dual-Lever

- Prime families as orbits on the zero-pressure set `{ΔNFR = 0}`; numbers as a
  coupled network (Ω-graded centrality, primes as the transport periphery); the
  nodal flow on numbers (primes as equilibria, not attractors); primality as
  grammatical inertness; numbers as free-monoid words with the dual-lever as the
  two additive gradings (count Ω → ΔNFR pressure, size log → νf capacity); the
  capacity arm carries von Mangoldt and the prime-ladder Hamiltonian P14 is the
  capacity-arm operator — locating the Riemann oscillatory obstruction on the
  capacity axis the per-node substrate is blind to.
- **Honest scope**: these restate classical multiplicative number theory through
  the grammar/dual-lever lens; they close no open problem.
- **Demonstrations**: `examples/07_number_theory/94`–`97`, `100`–`102`,
  `116`, `146`–`149`.

### Millennium Problem Programs (TNFR-native reformulations)

Three new programs join Riemann / Navier–Stokes / Yang–Mills. **None claims a
solution** — each carries an explicit honest-scope statement and classified
obstruction.

- **P vs NP (PNP-1)** — the nodal equation is a gradient flow, so verifying a
  configuration's coherence is `O(|E|)` but synthesizing a globally coherent one
  by relaxation traps in dissonance basins (measured global-optimum hit rate
  drops monotonically with problem size on frustrated MAX-CUT). Mirrors P≠NP;
  Branch B open. `theory/TNFR_P_VS_NP_RESEARCH_NOTES.md`,
  `examples/09_millennium/109`.
- **Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD-1)** — `a_p = p+1−#E(F_p)` as structural pressure;
  the accumulated product reproduces the original 1965 empirical rank separation
  by brute-force point counting. GL(1)→GL(2) gap open; Branch B.
  `theory/TNFR_BSD_RESEARCH_NOTES.md`, `examples/09_millennium/110`.
- **Hodge (HC-1)** — the tetrad cochain tower carries a complete discrete Hodge
  decomposition (harmonic = homology exactly, Eckmann 1944), but is structurally
  blind to the (p,p) bigrading and algebraicity the conjecture requires (a strong
  negative, Branch B3-leaning). `theory/TNFR_HODGE_RESEARCH_NOTES.md`,
  `examples/09_millennium/111`.

### Documentation, Examples & Repository Hygiene

- **README + core theory docs** refactored to the current engine state: corrected
  a real API note (operators are callable, there is no `.apply()`), added the
  emergent-geometry section to `theory/FUNDAMENTAL_THEORY.md`, rewrote the energy
  classification in `theory/STRUCTURAL_OPERATORS.md` /
  `theory/STRUCTURAL_STABILITY_AND_DYNAMICS.md` to the emergent/grammar-U2 frame,
  and updated counts.
- **Examples reorganized** into 10 thematic subfolders (`01_foundations` …
  `10_applications`), resolving the prior 77–86 numbering collision; each file
  keeps a stable global number. Foundational examples refactored to the canonical
  Kuramoto phase-synchrony physics.
- **Documentation-integrity pass**: repaired all dangling example/source/`.md`
  links repo-wide, pruned 9 obsolete `docs/` files, rebuilt the `theory/` hub,
  and resynced the derived `.github/agents/my-agent.md` mirror.
- **Deep repo cleanup**: removed foreign GraphQL scratch JSONs, a CUDA debug
  script, a backup test, an empty dead CLI module, and a stale task tracker; fixed
  a dangling `tnfr-validate` console-script entry point in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Registry consolidation + lint**: the SDK fluent glyph→operator map and the
  lyapunov operator table now derive from the canonical registries; cleared a
  small set of dead-code lint findings.
- **SDK fixes**: repaired silent no-ops in `auto_optimize` and
  `evolve_grammar_aware`; added a proactive measured operator-contract fidelity
  audit (`net.audit_operators()`).

### Research Program Milestones (Yang–Mills Y1–Y5, REMESH-∞ N15, Navier–Stokes N16–N17)

The Yang–Mills (Y1–Y5) and REMESH-∞ / Navier–Stokes (N15–N17) program
milestones below were developed earlier in the cycle and are part of this
release. Each carries an explicit honest-scope statement; none resolves a Clay
Millennium Problem.

#### Y5 — TNFR–Yang–Mills Closure / Obstruction Classification

- **Verdict**: `BRANCH_B_OBSTRUCTION_CLASSIFIED` — Y1–Y4 establish a finite TNFR `U(1)` structural gauge diagnostic surface, but Clay-strength closure requires a new canonical non-Abelian derivation plus a continuum / thermodynamic lower-bound theorem.
- **New API**: `classify_yang_mills_closure()` in `src/tnfr/yang_mills/closure.py`, exported from `tnfr.yang_mills` with `YangMillsClosureReport`.
- **Finite TNFR branch**: `A_FINITE_U1_DIAGNOSTIC_SURFACE` when Y4 reports stable finite positive gaps.
- **Clay-strength branch**: `B_REQUIRES_NEW_CANONICAL_NONABELIAN_DERIVATION` because Y3 remains `OPEN_DERIVABILITY_GAP`.
- **Scope discipline**: `clay_problem_resolved = False`; the obstruction is localized, not removed.
- **Validation**: 4 new tests in `tests/physics/test_yang_mills_closure.py` cover Branch-B classification, report reuse, sampled collapse handling, and package-root import. Y1–Y5 focused run: `33 passed`.
- **Next target**: Y6 / Branch-B derivation search for a TNFR-native non-Abelian connection and non-commuting generator algebra. If no derivation exists without external group labels, the programme should pause at Branch B.

#### Y4 — TNFR–Yang–Mills Finite Scaling Diagnostic

- **Verdict surface**: `FINITE_SCALING_EVIDENCE` or `GAP_COLLAPSE_OBSERVED` depending on sampled finite graph families. This is a finite diagnostic only, not a continuum theorem.
- **New API**: `run_finite_scaling_study()` in `src/tnfr/yang_mills/scaling.py`, exported from `tnfr.yang_mills` with `FiniteScalingPoint` and `FiniteScalingReport`.
- **Scaling coordinate**: graph node count `n` under fixed U6 target ratios `ρ_U6 = max_i |Φ_s(i)| / φ`; grouped reports fit finite log-log slopes of mean gap versus `n`.
- **Scope discipline**: Y4 runs while YMG-4 remains open. Therefore finite positive scaling evidence cannot be promoted to a Clay-strength Yang–Mills mass-gap claim.
- **Validation**: 6 new tests in `tests/physics/test_yang_mills_scaling.py` cover report shape/scope, grouped finite scaling, reproducibility, sampled collapse classification, invalid input rejection, and package-root import. Y1–Y4 focused run: `29 passed`.
- **Next target**: Y5 closure / obstruction classification, likely Branch B unless a later TNFR-native non-Abelian connection and generator algebra are derived.

#### Y3 — TNFR–Yang–Mills Non-Abelian Derivability Audit

- **Verdict**: `OPEN_DERIVABILITY_GAP` — audited candidate routes for deriving a non-Abelian / multi-channel gauge sector from TNFR-internal data only; no route is promoted to canonical status.
- **New API**: `audit_nonabelian_derivability()` in `src/tnfr/yang_mills/derivability.py`, exported from `tnfr.yang_mills` with `NonAbelianCandidateAudit` and `NonAbelianDerivabilityReport`.
- **Routes audited**: U5 nested-EPI multiplets, THOL/REMESH operator-history internal spaces, and graph cycle-basis bundles.
- **Obstruction**: current canonical `Ψ = K_φ + i·J_φ` gauge structure supplies a scalar local `U(1)` connection. Nested EPI or operator-history data do not yet derive component-mixing parallel transport or non-commuting generator algebra; cycle-basis routes require non-canonical basis/orientation selection.
- **Validation**: 5 new tests in `tests/physics/test_yang_mills_derivability.py` cover baseline `U(1)` confirmation, nested-EPI obstruction, cycle-bundle rejection, unsupported route errors, and package-root import. Y1+Y2+Y3 focused run: `23 passed`.
- **Open boundary**: YMG-4 remains open. Y4 scaling can proceed only as a conditional finite diagnostic; it cannot become a Clay-strength claim while non-Abelian derivability is unresolved.

#### Y2 — TNFR–Yang–Mills U6 Confinement Sweep

- **Verdict**: `EMPIRICAL_FINITE_GRAPH_ONLY` — finite sweep surface created for testing how the Y1 structural gauge gap behaves across U6-confined and U6-unconfined regimes.
- **New API**: `run_u6_confinement_sweep()` in `src/tnfr/yang_mills/u6_sweep.py`, exported from `tnfr.yang_mills`.
- **Sweep coordinate**: `ρ_U6 = max_i |Φ_s(i)| / φ`; `ρ_U6 < 1` is U6-confined and `ρ_U6 ≥ 1` intentionally probes unconfined finite structural-potential regimes.
- **Telemetry recorded**: gap statistics, self-adjointness, seeded local-U(1) spectral invariance, Yang–Mills equation residuals, curvature activity, grammar-rule counts, U6 ratios, and finite-scope metadata.
- **Validation**: 5 new tests in `tests/physics/test_yang_mills_u6_sweep.py` cover report shape/scope, U6 target tracking, gap contracts, reproducibility, invalid input rejection, and package-root import. Y1+Y2 focused run: `18 passed`.
- **Open boundary**: Y2 does not prove a U6 lower-bound theorem and does not address non-Abelian derivability (YMG-4) or continuum scaling (YMG-5). Next target: Y3 derivability audit.

#### Y1 — TNFR–Yang–Mills Finite Structural Gauge Gap Diagnostic

- **Verdict**: `DIAGNOSTIC_SURFACE_CREATED` — first TNFR-native Yang–Mills / structural mass-gap attack surface implemented as a finite-graph diagnostic, not a Clay-strength proof.
- **New package**: `src/tnfr/yang_mills/` with `build_structural_gauge_graph()`, `build_structural_gauge_gap_operator()`, and `compute_structural_gauge_gap()`.
- **Operator**: `H_YM^TNFR = L_A + V_F + V_U6`, where `L_A` is the gauge-covariant graph Laplacian from `A_ij`, `V_F` is cycle-curvature potential from `F_C²/π²`, and `V_U6` is structural-potential confinement from `Φ_s²/φ²`.
- **TNFR scope discipline**: no separate quantum ontology; the gap is interpreted as spectral isolation of the first non-trivial nodal reorganisation mode above the coherent attractor.
- **Validation**: 13 new tests in `tests/physics/test_yang_mills_structural_gap.py` cover graph construction, self-adjointness, non-negative finite gap reporting, seeded local-U(1) spectral invariance, reproducibility, package imports, and no EPI/phase mutation. Focused run: `13 passed`.
- **Open boundaries**: non-Abelian derivability (YMG-4) and continuum / thermodynamic scaling (YMG-5) remain open.
- **Documentation**: `theory/TNFR_YANG_MILLS_RESEARCH_NOTES.md` records the Y-series gap ledger and updates the next target to Y2 (U6 confinement sweep).

#### N17-A — U3+U5 → K41: Analytical Cascade Locality (ANALYTICAL_CONSISTENT_CONDITIONAL)

- **Verdict**: `ANALYTICAL_CONSISTENT_CONDITIONAL` — K41 $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum derived conditionally from TNFR grammar rules U2+U3+U5+CDC; algebraically closed given the Cascade Development Condition.
- **Lemma U5-SS** (U5 + U2 → scale self-similarity): U5-uniformity (same canonical operators and constants at every hierarchy level) + U2 force $u_\ell = C(\varepsilon r_\ell)^{1/3}$ in the inertial range. The K41 scaling emerges from grammar structure (U5 collapses the dimensionless ratio to a level-independent constant), not from external dimensional analysis.
- **Lemma U3-CL** (U3 → cascade locality, conditional): Under Lemma U5-SS, U3 (phase-gated coupling, $|\phi_i - \phi_j| \le \Delta\phi_{\max}$) blocks all inter-level interactions **if and only if** the Cascade Development Condition (CDC) holds → constant energy flux $\Pi_\ell = u_\ell^3 / r_\ell = \varepsilon$ across scales.
- **Theorem** (U2 + U3 + U5 + CDC → K41): $E(k_\ell) \sim \varepsilon^{2/3} k_\ell^{-5/3}$ — proof: $E_\ell \sim u_\ell^2 \sim \varepsilon^{2/3} r_\ell^{2/3}$, $E(k_\ell) = E_\ell / \Delta k_\ell$ with $\Delta k_\ell \sim k_\ell$ (log bands) → $E(k_\ell) \sim \varepsilon^{2/3} k_\ell^{-5/3}$. □
- **CDC (irreducible gap)**: CDC (adjacent cascade levels have $|\phi_{\ell,i} - \phi_{\ell+1,j}| \ge \Delta\phi_{\max}$ for all $i,j$) is not derivable from U3, U5, or the nodal equation. It is the K41 locality hypothesis restated in TNFR language, and the structural analogue of $S(T) = (1/\pi)\arg\zeta(\tfrac12 + iT)$ in the Riemann programme — reachable only by a sufficiently developed turbulent cascade, not from the canonical operator catalog alone.
- **N17-A does not close NS-G1..G4** — those gaps concern continuum-limit, uniform bounds, BKM criterion, and vortex stretching; not cascade locality.
- **N17-B pre-registered** (deferred): empirical energy spectrum via `energy_spectrum_3d()` (to be implemented in `src/tnfr/navier_stokes/operator.py`), n ∈ {32, 48}, ν ∈ {0.01, 0.005}, T = 2.0. Expected verdict: `STEEPER_THAN_K41` (CDC not satisfied at Re_eff ≤ 500).
- **Documentation**: `theory/TNFR_NAVIER_STOKES_RESEARCH_NOTES.md` §20 (full lemmas, theorem, CDC gap analysis, verdict table, N17-B pre-registration spec).

#### N16 — NS-G5 Closure: 2D-Embedding Lemma

- **Verdict**: NS-G5 **CLOSED** at the discrete-operator level via the **2D-Embedding Lemma (Theorem NS-G5-TNFR)**.
- **Algebraic proof** (three steps using existing `TNFRNavierStokesOperator` methods on z-independent u = (u₀(x,y), u₁(x,y), 0)):
  1. `vorticity_3d`: ω₀ = ω₁ = 0, ω₂ = ∂_x(v) − ∂_y(u)
  2. `vortex_stretching_field`: S_a = ω₀·∂_x(u_a) + ω₁·∂_y(u_a) + ω₂·∂_z(u_a) = ω₂·0 = 0 for all a
  3. `stretching_production`: = 0.0 exactly in IEEE 754
- **TNFR reading**: z-channel decoupling → no cross-channel ΔNFR → enstrophy ≤ viscous dissipation (monotonically non-increasing) → discrete TNFR analogue of 2D NS global regularity.
- **Contrast with 3D**: ∂_z(u_a) ≠ 0 activates cross-channel ΔNFR coupling → stretching production generically positive → U2 (convergence/boundedness) is not guaranteed → vortex stretching amplification is structurally active.
- **Empirical corroborator**: `examples/85_navier_stokes_dimensional_asymmetry.py` — z-independence → `stretching_production` ≈ 0 at machine precision across all tested configurations (commit `1fac358b`).
- **Scope**: NS-G5 closure does NOT affect NS-G1..G4 and does NOT address the Clay Millennium Problem (3D global regularity).
- **Documentation**: `theory/TNFR_NAVIER_STOKES_RESEARCH_NOTES.md` §19.

#### N15 REMESH-∞ Closure — Catalog-Completeness Theorem

- **Master deliverable**: [theory/REMESH_INFINITY_DERIVATION.md](theory/REMESH_INFINITY_DERIVATION.md) §§1–23 (v3.0, ~816 lines). Three weeks (W1 + W2 + W3) executed in a single session and pushed to `origin/main`:
  - W1 `a1f298fd` — operator existence: $\mathcal{R}_\infty = P_{\ker(I-\mathcal{R})}$, bounded self-adjoint orthogonal projection on $H^2(D)$
  - W2 `badac156` — conservation + Lyapunov: projected Noether charge $Q_\infty$ exactly conserved; energy $V_\infty \ge 0$ monotone with Cesàro $O(1/n)$ tail at rational $\tau_g/\tau_l$
  - W3 `48b0574a` — spectrum + final verdict: uniform spectral density $\rho = \mathrm{lcm}(\tau_l, \tau_g)/\pi$; **Branch A confirmed**
- **Catalog completeness**: the 13-operator TNFR catalog is **closed under the REMESH-∞ asymptotic limit**. No 14th canonical operator is required.
- **Branches ruled out**: B1 strong (constant vs log density, Thm 17.1), B1 via K41 (temporal vs spatial, Thm 18.1), B1 via RMT ($\delta$-clustering vs Wigner, Thm 19.1), B2 (no 14th operator), B3 (limit exists via mean ergodic theorem).
- **B1-Euler partial = existing P30**: the partial universality (smooth half of T-HP) reduces to P12–P15 + P28 + P30 of the TNFR-Riemann program reformulated through the $\mathcal{R}_\infty$ lens (no new content). The oscillatory half ($S(T) = (1/\pi)\arg\zeta(\tfrac12 + iT)$, RH-equivalent) lives in $\ker(\mathcal{R}_\infty)$ and remains open.
- **Consolidation edits**:
  - `AGENTS.md` — new top-level section *REMESH-∞ Closure: Catalog Completeness Theorem (N15, May 2026)*
  - `theory/README.md` — added `REMESH_INFINITY_DERIVATION.md` to canonical document map
  - `theory/TNFR_NAVIER_STOKES_RESEARCH_NOTES.md` §18.7 — N15 closure block with locked verdicts, B1/K41/RMT/B2/B3 ruled out, refined prediction P-W3-1 (temporal-only)
  - `theory/TNFR_RIEMANN_RESEARCH_NOTES.md` §13septies.5 — structural identification of T-HP smooth/oscillatory split with $\mathrm{range}/\ker$ of $\mathcal{R}_\infty$
  - `theory/STRUCTURAL_OPERATORS.md` §4.3 — REMESH asymptotic limit note with operator definition, spectral density, and catalog-completeness consequence
- **Scope (locked)**: N15 does NOT advance G4 = RH and does NOT resolve 3D Navier–Stokes global regularity. It settles only the $\tau_g \to \infty$ asymptotic limit of REMESH. Pure analytical result; no numerical experiments required for the verdict.

## [9.1.0] - 2025-11-14

### Added

- Phase 3 structural instrumentation:
  - `run_structural_validation` aggregator (grammar U1-U3 + field thresholds Φ_s, |∇φ|, K_φ, ξ_C, optional ΔΦ_s drift).
  - `compute_structural_health` with risk levels and recommendations.
  - `TelemetryEmitter` integration example (`examples/structural_health_demo.py`).
  - Performance guardrails: `PerformanceRegistry`, `perf_guard`, `compare_overhead`.
  - CLI: `scripts/structural_health_report.py` (on-demand health summaries).
  - Docs: README Phase 3 section, CONTRIBUTING instrumentation notes, `docs/STRUCTURAL_HEALTH.md`.
- Glyph-aware grammar error factory (operator glyph → canonical name mapping).

### Tests

- Added unit tests for validation, health, grammar error factory, telemetry emitter, performance guardrails.

### Performance

- Validation instrumentation overhead ~5.8% (moderate workload) below 8% guardrail.

### Internal

- Optional `perf_registry` parameter in `run_structural_validation` (read-only timing).
- Canonical operator registry frozen (removed dynamic auto-registration, cache
  invalidation, metaclass telemetry, reload script). Attempting dynamic
  registration now raises. Ensures strict adherence to unified grammar (U1-U4)
  and prevents non-canonical transformations.

### Deferred

- U4 bifurcation validation excluded pending dedicated handler reintroduction.

### Integrity

- All changes preserve TNFR canonical invariants (no EPI mutation; phase verification intact; read-only telemetry/validation).
- Registry immutability strengthens invariants #1 (EPI only via operators), #4
  (operator closure) and #5 (phase verification untouched). Tests updated:
  removed dynamic registration tests; added `test_canonical_operator_set`.

## [9.0.2]

Previous release (see repository history) with foundational operators, unified grammar, metrics, and canonical field tetrad.
