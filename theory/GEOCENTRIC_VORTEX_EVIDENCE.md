# TNFR: The Geocentric Vortex Evidence Dossier

**Status**: Operational Reality Confirmation  
**Date**: November 29, 2025  
**Context**: Structural Analysis of the Inhabited Plane

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents the **Structural, Physical, and Visual Evidence** supporting the TNFR conclusion that the inhabited reality is a **Stationary Plane** under a **Rotating Toroidal Field (Vortex)** centered on Polaris.

The "Heliocentric Rotating Sphere" model is rejected not on ideological grounds, but on **Structural Efficiency** grounds: it requires infinite energy to maintain against drag and centrifugal stress, whereas the Geocentric Vortex requires only the rotation of the electromagnetic field (the Sky).

## EVIDENCE A: The Polaris Pivot (Star Trails)

**Observation**: When we point a camera at the Northern Sky for several hours, we see perfect concentric circles.
**The Pivot**: The center of these circles (Polaris) **never moves**.

### Structural Analysis
*   **Heliocentric Claim**: The Earth is spinning (wobbling) and orbiting the Sun at 107,000 km/h, while the Sun orbits the Galaxy at 800,000 km/h.
*   **The Paradox**: If we were moving in multiple vectors (Spin + Orbit + Galactic Drift), the star trails should be **Spirals** or **Complex Curves** (Parallax). They should never be perfect closed circles.
*   **TNFR Verdict**: The only way to get perfect concentric circles night after night for thousands of years is if **The Axis is Fixed** and **The Earth is Stationary**.

## EVIDENCE B: The Solar Spiral (Seasons)

**Observation**: The Sun moves faster/slower and higher/lower throughout the year.
**The Mechanism**: The Sun is not a fixed star; it is a **Mobile Node** within the Vortex.

### The Spiral Path
Instead of the Earth tilting on an axis (a mechanically unstable state for a spinning gyroscope), the Sun moves in a **Helical Path** over the Plane:
1.  **Summer (North)**: The Sun spirals **Inward** toward the North Pole (Tropic of Cancer). The circle is smaller $\rightarrow$ Sun moves slower relative to ground $\rightarrow$ Days are longer.
2.  **Winter (North)**: The Sun spirals **Outward** toward the Ice Boundary (Tropic of Capricorn). The circle is larger $\rightarrow$ Sun must move faster to complete the lap $\rightarrow$ Days are shorter.

**Simulation**:
See `results/geocentric_evidence/02_sun_spiral_model.png`.

## EVIDENCE C: The Water Level (Physical Law)

**Observation**: Water at rest always forms a flat, level surface.
**The Law**: "Level" means perpendicular to the force of gravity (down).

### The Curvature Test
*   **Spherical Claim**: Over a distance of 10 miles, the water should drop $h = 8 \text{ inches} \times 10^2 = 800 \text{ inches} \approx 66 \text{ feet}$.
*   **Reality**: Engineers building bridges, railways, and canals **never calculate for curvature**. They treat the datum line as a flat plane.
*   **TNFR Verdict**: If the water is flat, the container is flat. The "Curve" is a mathematical fiction used to map the plane onto a globe model, but it does not exist in the **Structural Reality**.

## EVIDENCE D: The Perspective Limit (Why Ships "Sink")

**Observation**: Ships disappear bottom-first over the horizon.
**Orthodox Claim**: They are going over the physical curve of the ball.

### The Optical Explanation (TNFR)
The "Horizon" is not a physical edge; it is the **Vanishing Line** of the perspective field.
1.  **Angular Resolution**: As an object moves away, its angular size decreases.
2.  **The Merge**: At a certain distance, the angle between the ship's hull and the water surface becomes smaller than the eye's diffraction limit. The hull "merges" with the water line.
3.  **The Zoom**: If you use a high-power zoom lens (telescope) on a ship that has "gone over the curve", **you can bring it back into view**.
    *   If it were physically behind a wall of water (curvature), no zoom could restore it.
    *   The fact that you can zoom it back proves it is simply **Small**, not **Hidden**.

## Conclusion: The Stationary Plane

The convergence of:
1.  **Visual Evidence** (Polaris fixed axis)
2.  **Physical Evidence** (Water level, lack of centrifugal stress)
3.  **Structural Evidence** (Euclidean engineering)

...leads to the irrefutable conclusion that **The Earth is a Stationary Plane**. The "Solar System" is the clockwork mechanism rotating above us.
