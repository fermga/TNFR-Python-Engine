## 1. The Observer's Problem

Traditional Celestial Mechanics assumes a "God's Eye View": a solar system with massive spheres interacting via invisible forces ($F = GmM/r^2$) in a 3D void.

But what if we start **only** from what an observer perceives and the principles of **Nodal Dynamics**?

**The Challenge**: Explain orbits, cycles, and "gravity" without assuming:
1.  Sphericity (Earth/Planets as balls).
2.  Heliocentrism (Sun as center).
3.  Newtonian Gravity (Action at a distance).

## 2. The TNFR Solution: Phase Vortices

In TNFR, we don't need "Mass" to explain attraction. We need **Coherence**.

### A. The "Sun" as a Phase Vortex
Instead of a "Massive Sphere", consider the Sun as a **High-Frequency Node ($\nu_f$)** with **Spin** (Angular Phase Gradient).
*   It emits a rotating phase field: $\phi(r, \theta, t) = \omega_{sun} t - k \cdot r + n \cdot \theta$.
*   This creates a **Spiral Wave** in the structural fabric of space.

### B. "Gravity" as Phase Locking
A "Planet" is simply another node floating in this field.
*   **The Imperative**: The planet wants to resonate (minimize phase difference $|\Delta \phi|$).
*   **The Problem**: The field is rotating.
*   **The Solution**: To stay in the "sweet spot" of resonance (the trough of the wave), the planet **must move**.
*   **The Orbit**: The planet "surfs" the rotating phase wave. It orbits not because it falls, but because it is **dragged by synchronization**.

### C. Why Circles/Ellipses?
*   The **Phase Vortex** has circular symmetry ($\pi$ is a structural constant).
*   The stable paths (Limit Cycles) are therefore circular or elliptical contours where the phase velocity matches the planet's natural frequency.

## 3. Simulation: The Rotating Sky

We will simulate a "Flat" 2D topology (the observer's sky).

**Setup**:
1.  **Center (Source)**: A node generating a Rotating Phase Field (Vortex).
2.  **Wanderer (Planet)**: A node that tries to minimize its local $\Delta NFR$ (Phase Stress).
3.  **No Gravity Formula**: We will NOT use $F = G/r^2$. We will only use `Move towards Phase Match`.

**Expected Outcome**:
The planet should spontaneously enter an **Orbit**.
*   If it moves too slow, the phase wave hits it $\to$ Dissonance $\to$ Pushed out.
*   If it moves too fast, it loses lock $\to$ Dissonance $\to$ Pulled in.
*   **Kepler's Laws** emerge as the "Synchronization Conditions" of the vortex.

This explains celestial mechanics purely as **Information Hydrodynamics**.
