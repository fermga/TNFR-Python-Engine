## 1. Research Question

Do calcite microcrystals in the pineal gland act as piezoelectric sensors for structural fields characterized by \(\Delta \text{NFR}\)? All claims must reference telemetry: measured stresses, voltages, and resulting neural activity stored under `results/pineal_tnfr/`.

---

## 2. Proposed Mechanism

1. Structural perturbations induce mechanical stress in tissue.  
2. Piezoelectric crystals convert stress to voltage according to \(V = d \sigma\).  
3. Generated voltage influences neural firing rates via synaptic coupling.  

This sequence is testable by measuring piezoelectric coefficients and neural responses under controlled stimulation; log seeds, pressure profiles, and EM field strengths for reproducibility.

---

## 3. Experimental Plan

1. Characterize crystal composition/orientation via microscopy and X-ray diffraction.  
2. Apply calibrated pressure/EM fields to ex vivo samples; record voltage outputs with calibrated amplifiers.  
3. Determine whether signals propagate to downstream neurons in vitro/in vivo; track \(C(t)\), \(|\nabla \phi|\), and \(\nu_f\) changes in associated neural ensembles.  
4. Compare responses against sham controls to rule out artifacts.

## 4. Outstanding Work

1. Publish datasets containing piezoelectric coefficients, stress profiles, and voltage traces with uncertainty budgets.  
2. Develop a coupled simulation linking measured voltages to TNFR node dynamics and validate against neural recordings.  
3. Document experimental protocols (microscopy, stimulation, recording) and release analysis notebooks for peer replication.
