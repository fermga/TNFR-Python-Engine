## 1. The Geocentric Challenge

Modeling the Solar System from Earth's perspective is topologically complex. We observe:
1.  **The Sun**: A simple annual circle.
2.  **The Moon**: A simple monthly circle.
3.  **The Planets**: Complex **Epicycles** (Retrograde Motion). They move forward, stop, go backward, and move forward again.

**Traditional Explanation**:
*   **Ptolemy**: Circles on circles (Epicycles).
*   **Copernicus/Kepler**: It's an illusion caused by Earth's motion around the Sun.

**TNFR Explanation**:
It is **Multi-Frequency Resonance**.
*   The "Ether" (Phase Field) has multiple overlapping frequencies (Harmonics).
*   Planets are nodes resonating with **Interference Patterns** between the Solar Cycle and the Zodiacal Cycle.

## 2. The Simulation Setup

We will simulate the sky as a **Composite Phase Field**.

**Center**: Earth (Observer) at (0,0).

**The Fields**:
1.  **The Carrier Wave (The Zodiac)**: A slow background rotation ($\omega_{stars}$).
2.  **The Driver (The Sun)**: A strong, faster vortex ($\omega_{sun}$).
3.  **The Perturbation (The Planet)**: A node caught between these two influences.

**Dynamics**:
*   **Sun**: Driven purely by the Daily/Annual cycle.
*   **Moon**: Driven by the Lunar cycle.
*   **Mars (Planet)**: Driven by the Solar cycle BUT with a **Phase Lag** (Resonance offset).
    *   When the Sun passes Mars, the phase interference creates a "loop" in the trajectory (Retrograde Motion).

**Expected Outcome**:
We should see the classic **Spirograph Patterns** (Epicycles) emerging naturally from the interaction of two simple circular frequencies, without needing to program "spheres" or "gravity".
