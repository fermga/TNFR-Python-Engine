## 1. Scope

Describe testable hypotheses for neural-environment coupling using TNFR operators and telemetry. The memo outlines the mathematical constraints, experimental programs, and validation artifacts required to evaluate any consciousness-related proposal.

---

## 2. Coupling Model

- Represent neural assemblies as EPIs with structural frequencies \(0.5 \text{ Hz} \le \nu_f^n \le 100 \text{ Hz}\).  
- Let \(\mathcal{E}_b\) denote the background field; coupling is admissible only when
	\[
	|\phi_n - \phi_b| \le \Delta \phi_{\max}
	\]
	(grammar rule U3).  
- Required observables: \(\nu_f^n\) from EEG/MEG, \(\Phi_s^n\) from hemodynamic proxies, and \(|\nabla \phi|\) from phase-gradient tomography or simulation.

Telemetry for each study should include time series of \(C(t)\), \(\Phi_s\), \(|\nabla \phi|\), operator schedules, and seed/configuration metadata.

## 3. Pineal Transduction Program

Treat pineal calcite microcrystals as candidate mixed-mode transducers. Experimental checklist:

1. Micro-CT or diffraction study to map crystal orientation/density.  
2. Measure mechanical-to-electric transfer functions under physiologic stresses.  
3. Compare gain/bandwidth with predominant \(\nu_f^n\) bands.  

Reject the coupling hypothesis if measured bandwidth lacks overlap with neural frequencies or if transfer coefficients fall below instrumentation noise floors.

---

## 4. Neural Resonant Modes

- Segment rhythms into delta/theta/alpha/beta/gamma bands and record spatial maps of \(|\nabla \phi|\).  
- Verify that cross-frequency interactions obey operator grammar (e.g., `UM` between thalamic and cortical EPIs only when phase tolerance holds).  
- When testing environmental entrainment (e.g., Schumann bands), provide statistical correlations and control conditions; anecdotal associations are insufficient.

---

## 5. Memory Access and Coherence Length

Memory recall is modeled as reactivating a stored EPI trace. The coherence length \(\xi_C\) indicates how far correlations persist. Any hypothesis invoking extra-neural storage must specify:

1. Storage medium and structural fields used.  
2. Operators enabling write/read phases.  
3. Telemetry demonstrating reproducible coupling.  

Claims lacking these elements are non-falsifiable and should not proceed.

---

## 6. Inter-subject Coupling Tests

For proposed telepathy-like effects model two neural EPIs \(A\) and \(B\) as coupled oscillators. Acceptance criteria:

1. Identified physical channel (EM, mechanical, chemical).  
2. Verified phase tolerance per U3.  
3. Mutual information above chance with documented statistics.  

Assertions of superluminal coupling require a mediator consistent with TNFR fields plus direct measurements; otherwise they remain out of scope.

---

## 7. Open Questions

1. Can impedance-matching measurements be performed in vivo to quantify coupling efficiency?  
2. What instrumentation is needed to map \(|\nabla \phi|\) at sub-centimeter resolution in cortical tissue?  
3. How sensitive are proposed mechanisms to artifacts (motion, thermal noise)? Document rejection thresholds.
