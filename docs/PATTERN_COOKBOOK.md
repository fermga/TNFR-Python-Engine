2. **Reception (EN)**: Non-judgmental reception of crisis without validation requirements
3. **Coherence (IL)**: Emergency stabilization, grounding in present moment
4. **Dissonance (OZ)**: Acknowledge crisis tension (brief, contained)
5. **Contraction (NUL)**: Focus on immediate coping essentials only
6. **Coherence (IL)**: Deeper stabilization layer
7. **Coupling (UM)**: Connect to immediate support/resources
8. **Silence (SHA)**: Reparative pause, minimal integration

**Key insights**:
- Fast stabilization prioritized over deep transformation
- Controlled dissonance acknowledged but not explored
- Contraction focuses attention on manageable coping strategies
- High sustainability (0.80) for maintaining gains post-intervention

**Metrics**:
- Balance: 0.33 (stabilizer-heavy, appropriate for crisis)
- Sustainability: 0.80 (good short-term maintenance)
- Complexity Efficiency: 0.88 (efficient for length)

**Variations**:
- Add `resonance` after first coherence for enhanced emotional regulation (+0.03 health)
