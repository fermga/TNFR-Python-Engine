# TNFR Optimization Phase 3 Roadmap

**Status**: 🟡 PLANNING
**Proposed Start**: 2025-11-14
**Estimated Duration**: 8–12 hours
**Theme**: Enhanced Tools & Utilities (interactive clarity, telemetry depth, structural introspection)

---

## 🚀 Executive Intent

Phase 3 focuses on ergonomics: diagnostics, validation, telemetry expansion, introspection utilities — always preserving TNFR physics.

1. Transparency of resonance/coherence dynamics
2. Reduced friction applying operators & grammar
3. Stronger reproducibility and invariant verification
4. Clear theory → code traceability

---

## 🎯 Objectives

| Objective | Success Criteria | KPI Target |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| CLI Validation | Actionable phase/grammar hints | 90% misuse auto-diagnosed |
| Telemetry Depth | Export core structural metrics | 100% operator applications logged |
| Operator Introspection | Query contracts & roles | Complete descriptor coverage |
| Health Automation | Single command health score | JSON + summary output |
| Error Canonicalization | Tagged rule + physics rationale | 100% new errors tagged |
| Gallery Expansion | 4 minimal examples | All pass smoke tests |

---

## 📋 Task Outline

1. Telemetry Unification (2–3h) – emitter + hooks
2. Operator Introspection (1.5–2h) – descriptor API
3. Grammar-Aware Errors (1–1.5h) – factory & refactor
4. Validator Enhancement (1–2h) – suggestions & phase checker
5. Health Check Automation (1–1.5h) – repo_health_check.py
6. Example Gallery (1h) – 4 demos
7. (Optional) Performance Guardrails (0.5–1h) – overhead bench

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Telemetry coverage | 100% operator applications |
| Introspection completeness | 13/13 operators |
| Error tagging | 100% new GrammarViolation sources |
| Suggestion accuracy | ≥90% heuristic cases |
| Example smoke pass | 4/4 |
| Telemetry overhead | <3% latency impact |

---

## 🛡️ Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Latency overhead | Buffered writes + batch flush |
| Inconsistent error tags | Central factory enforcement |
| Descriptor drift | Regenerate docs table each release |
| Suggestion false positives | Limit to deterministic grammar heuristics |

---

## Alignment Matrix

| Invariant | Support |
|-----------|---------|
| #3 ΔNFR semantics | Telemetry logs gradient physically |
| #5 Phase verification | Live diagnostics |
| #8 Controlled determinism | Seed stamped in telemetry header |
| #9 Structural metrics | Unified emitter enrichment |

---

## Testing Strategy

Unit, integration, property (phase suggestions), performance (<3%), regression (schema snapshot).

---

## Commit Template
