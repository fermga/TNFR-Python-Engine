# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that provides context about the evolution of the TNFR Python Engine but is no longer part of the active documentation set.

## Structure

```

└── README.md        # This file

## Phase Reports

The `phases/` directory contains implementation reports from major development phases:

- **PHASE2_COMPLETE.md**: Phase 2 completion report
- **PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: Phase 2 detailed implementation
- **PHASE2_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Phase 2 migration guide
- **PHASE3_FINAL_REPORT.md**: Phase 3 completion report
- **PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: Phase 3 detailed implementation
- **PHASE4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: Phase 4 detailed implementation
- **SESSION4_FINAL_REPORT.md**: Session 4 final report
- **IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md**: General implementation completion notes
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: General implementation summary

These documents provide historical context about feature development, architectural decisions, and implementation details from specific project phases.

## Why Archived?

These files were moved to the archive during **Phase 5: Documentation Consolidation** (November 2025) to:

1. **Reduce redundancy**: Consolidated overlapping documentation
2. **Improve clarity**: Single source of truth per concern
3. **Ease onboarding**: Clearer documentation structure
4. **Preserve history**: Maintain context without cluttering active docs

## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see:

- **README.md**: Project overview and quick start
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System architecture and design
- **SECURITY.md**: Security policy and best practices
- **TESTING.md**: Test strategy and guidelines
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contribution workflow
- **AGENTS.md**: Guide for AI agents
- **GLOSSARY.md**: TNFR terminology

## Note

These archived documents are preserved for reference but may not reflect the current state of the codebase. Always consult the active documentation for up-to-date information.
