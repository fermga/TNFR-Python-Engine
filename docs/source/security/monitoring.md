# Security monitoring dashboard

The TNFR engine security discipline aggregates automated signals to catch regressions, vulnerabilities, and deviations in the structural coherence of the codebase. This dashboard distills the artifacts generated by CodeQL, Dependabot, `pip-audit`, and SAST checks (Bandit and Semgrep) and sets a shared review cadence for the team.

## Dashboard sources

| Source | Location | Primary output | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CodeQL | `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` | SARIF (`codeql-*-results`) | Tracks insecure code alerts and patterns that reduce `C(t)` in critical nodes. |
| Dependabot | `/.github/dependabot.yml` | Native GitHub alerts | Detects dependency misalignment and dissonance events triggered by known CVEs. |
| `pip-audit` | `.github/workflows/pip-audit.yml` | JSON (`pip-audit.json`) | Evaluates vulnerabilities in installed packages and their impact on νf and the execution phase. |
| Bandit + Semgrep | `.github/workflows/sast-lint.yml` | SARIF (`bandit.sarif`, `semgrep.sarif`) | Identifies risk patterns and records containment decisions within TNFR operators. |

Individual security workflows automatically upload their results to GitHub Security tab and as workflow artifacts for review.

## Review cadence

- **Weekly (Mondays)**: Review security scan results from GitHub Security tab and workflow artifacts. This review aligns with the existing CodeQL (`03:00 UTC`) and `pip-audit` (`05:00 UTC`) cron schedules.
- **After every critical alert**: trigger a controlled dissonance session on the affected component, document the resolution, and update the `C(t)` and `Si` metrics when applicable.
- **Monthly**: audit the Dependabot configuration, SAST rule coverage, and the dashboard scope to uphold operator closure and fidelity to TNFR semantics.

## What to expect in workflow artifacts

1. **CodeQL**: SARIF files in the `codeql-python-results` artifact with detailed security analysis
2. **Bandit + Semgrep**: SARIF files (`bandit-sarif`, `semgrep-sarif`) uploaded to GitHub Security tab
3. **pip-audit**: JSON report artifact (`pip-audit-report`) with dependency vulnerability details
4. All results are accessible via GitHub Security tab and workflow run artifacts

Security findings are automatically integrated into GitHub's native security alerts for centralized monitoring.
