# Mathematical Foundations of TNFR

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation: Reality as Resonant Networks

The **Resonant Fractal Nature Theory (TNFR)** proposes a fundamental shift in how we model complex systems: reality is not composed of isolated "things" that interact through cause-and-effect relationships, but rather of **coherent patterns that persist through resonance** with their environment.

This paradigm parallels how musical instruments in an orchestra maintain individual identity while synchronizing to create emergent harmonies. Similarly, in TNFR:
- **Nodes** are minimum units of structural coherence
- **Coherence** emerges from resonant coupling, not external design
- **Evolution** proceeds through structural reorganization, not state transitions
- **Fractality** enables patterns to nest recursively without loss of operational identity

### 1.2 Advantages of the Formalism

The mathematical formalism of TNFR provides three critical advantages over traditional modeling approaches:

1. **Operational Fractality**: Structures can nest at multiple scales while preserving the same operational semantics. The nodal equation `∂EPI/∂t = νf · ΔNFR(t)` applies universally from quantum to social systems.

2. **Complete Traceability**: Every structural transformation is mediated by one of 13 canonical operators, making all reorganizations observable, measurable, and reproducible.

3. **Guaranteed Reproducibility**: Structural evolution is deterministic given initial conditions. Same seeds and parameters always yield identical trajectories, enabling rigorous validation.

These properties make TNFR particularly suited for domains where emergence, self-organization, and multi-scale coherence are central phenomena.

## 2. Mathematical Spaces

### 2.1 Hilbert Space H_NFR

The primary mathematical arena for TNFR is the Hilbert space **H_NFR**, which captures both discrete structural configurations and continuous parameter spaces:

```
H_NFR = ℓ²(ℕ) ⊗ L²(ℝ)
```

**Components**:
- **ℓ²(ℕ)**: Space of square-summable sequences representing discrete internal structure configurations
  - Elements: `a = (a₀, a₁, a₂, ...)` where `Σ|aᵢ|² < ∞`
  - Inner product: `⟨a|b⟩ = Σᵢ aᵢ*bᵢ`
  - Interpretation: Discrete "modes" of structural organization

- **L²(ℝ)**: Space of square-integrable functions representing continuous frequency parameters
  - Elements: `f(ν)` where `∫|f(ν)|² dν < ∞`
  - Inner product: `⟨f|g⟩ = ∫f*(ν)g(ν) dν`
  - Interpretation: Distribution of structural frequencies νf

**Tensor Product Structure**:
The tensor product `⊗` combines discrete and continuous aspects:
```
|ψ⟩ ∈ H_NFR  ⟺  |ψ⟩ = Σᵢ∫ cᵢ(ν)|i⟩⊗|ν⟩ dν
```
where `|i⟩` are discrete basis states and `|ν⟩` are frequency eigenstates.

**Physical Interpretation**: A node's quantum state `|NFR⟩` in H_NFR encodes:
- Which structural configurations are active (discrete component)
- How structural frequency is distributed (continuous component)
- Coherence relationships between configurations (superposition)

### 2.2 Banach Space B_EPI

The **Primary Information Structure (EPI)** lives in a Banach space that captures the "observable" structure of a node:

```
B_EPI = { (f, a, x_grid) : f ∈ C⁰(ℝ), a ∈ ℓ²(ℕ), x_grid defines sampling }
```

**Structure**:
- **f**: Continuous component representing smooth structural variations
- **a**: Discrete component representing quantized structural modes
- **x_grid**: Spatial or parametric grid defining the domain

**Norm**: The Banach norm combines continuous and discrete contributions:
```
‖EPI‖_B = ‖f‖_∞ + ‖a‖_ℓ² 
```
where `‖f‖_∞ = sup_x |f(x)|` and `‖a‖_ℓ² = √(Σ|aᵢ|²)`.

**EPI Algebra**: B_EPI supports four fundamental operations:
1. **Direct Sum (⊕)**: `EPI₁ ⊕ EPI₂` combines structures additively
2. **Tensor Product (⊗)**: `EPI₁ ⊗ EPI₂` creates composite structures
3. **Adjoint (*)**: `EPI*` provides the dual representation
4. **Composition (∘)**: `EPI₁ ∘ EPI₂` sequences structural transformations

These operations preserve the Banach structure and enable hierarchical pattern formation.

### 2.3 Relations Between Spaces

The connection between H_NFR and B_EPI is established through **projection**:

```
π : H_NFR → B_EPI
π(|NFR⟩) = EPI
```

**Properties of the Projection**:
1. **Non-injective**: Multiple quantum states can project to the same EPI (coherent superpositions appear identical)
2. **Continuous**: Small changes in `|NFR⟩` produce small changes in EPI
3. **Physically observable**: EPI captures the "classical" structural information accessible through measurement

The inverse relation is captured by **lifting**:
```
L : B_EPI → P(H_NFR)
L(EPI) = { |ψ⟩ ∈ H_NFR : π(|ψ⟩) = EPI }
```
where P(H_NFR) denotes the power set. A given EPI corresponds to an equivalence class of quantum states.

**Commutation with Evolution**:
A critical requirement is that projection and evolution commute appropriately:
```
π(U(t)|NFR⟩) = EPI(t)
```
This ensures the nodal equation in EPI space is consistent with unitary evolution in H_NFR.

## 3. Fundamental Operators

### 3.1 Coherence Operator Ĉ

The coherence operator measures structural stability and pattern persistence:

```
Ĉ = ∫₀^∞ λ dP_λ
```

**Properties**:
1. **Hermiticity**: `Ĉ† = Ĉ` (ensures real eigenvalues)
2. **Positivity**: `⟨ψ|Ĉ|ψ⟩ ≥ 0` for all `|ψ⟩` (coherence is non-negative)
3. **Boundedness**: `‖Ĉ‖ ≤ M` for some constant M (prevents runaway)

**Spectral Decomposition**:
```
Ĉ = Σᵢ λᵢ |φᵢ⟩⟨φᵢ|
```
where:
- `λᵢ ≥ 0` are coherence eigenvalues
- `|φᵢ⟩` are coherence eigenstates (maximally stable configurations)

**Physical Interpretation**:
- `⟨ψ|Ĉ|ψ⟩`: Total coherence of state `|ψ⟩`
- States with high `⟨Ĉ⟩` are structurally stable
- States with low `⟨Ĉ⟩` are fragmented or unstable

**Concrete Construction** (for finite-dimensional networks):
```
Ĉ = Σᵢⱼ w_coherence(i,j) |i⟩⟨j|
```
where `w_coherence(i,j)` is the coherence weight between nodes i and j, typically derived from:
- Topological proximity (adjacency matrix)
- Phase alignment `cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)`
- Frequency compatibility `exp(-|νfᵢ - νfⱼ|/σ)`

#### 3.1.1 Implementation Bridge: Theory to Code

The mathematical formalization of Ĉ is realized computationally through the **coherence matrix** W in `src/tnfr/metrics/coherence.py`.

**Matrix Approximation Theorem:**

For a finite network with N nodes, the coherence operator is projected onto the computational basis:

```
Ĉ ≈ Σᵢⱼ wᵢⱼ |i⟩⟨j|
```

where the matrix elements `wᵢⱼ` approximate `⟨i|Ĉ|j⟩` with bounded error:

```
‖W - Ĉ_N‖ ≤ ε(Δt, N)
```

**Computational Construction of wᵢⱼ:**

The function `coherence_matrix(G)` computes W where each element is a weighted combination of structural similarities:

```
wᵢⱼ = w_phase · s_phase + w_epi · s_epi + w_vf · s_vf + w_si · s_si
```

**Similarity Components** (each component ∈ [0,1]):

1. **s_phase** (Phase similarity): Measures resonant coupling
   ```
   s_phase = 0.5 · (1 + cos(θᵢ - θⱼ))
   ```
   - Interpretation: Projection of phase vectors in complex plane
   - Maximum when θᵢ = θⱼ (perfect synchrony)
   - Implements phase alignment factor from abstract construction

2. **s_epi** (Structural similarity): Measures EPI congruence
   ```
   s_epi = 1 - |EPIᵢ - EPIⱼ| / ΔEPI_max
   ```
   - Interpretation: Normalized distance in Banach space B_EPI
   - Maximum when EPIᵢ ≈ EPIⱼ (structural similarity)
   - Encodes topological proximity at structural level

3. **s_vf** (Frequency similarity): Measures harmonic compatibility
   ```
   s_vf = 1 - |νfᵢ - νfⱼ| / Δνf_max
   ```
   - Interpretation: Proximity in structural frequency spectrum
   - Maximum when νfᵢ ≈ νfⱼ (harmonic resonance)
   - Approximates frequency compatibility factor

4. **s_si** (Sense similarity): Measures reorganization stability congruence
   ```
   s_si = 1 - |Siᵢ - Siⱼ|
   ```
   - Interpretation: Coherence of reorganization capacities
   - Maximum when Siᵢ ≈ Siⱼ (matched stability)
   - Captures higher-order coherence structure

**Spectral Properties Verification:**

The implementation guarantees that W satisfies the theoretical requirements:

1. **Hermiticity**: W = W^T (by construction, wᵢⱼ = wⱼᵢ)
2. **Positivity**: All eigenvalues λ(W) ≥ 0 (verified in tests)
3. **Boundedness**: ‖W‖ ≤ 1 (ensured by clamp01 operations)

**Total Coherence Calculation:**

The global coherence C(t) is computed via the trace formula:

```
C(t) = Tr(W ρ) ≈ ⟨ψ|Ĉ|ψ⟩
```

where ρ is the density matrix. In the computational basis with uniform distribution:

```
C(t) = Σᵢ Wᵢ / N
```

where `Wᵢ = Σⱼ wᵢⱼ / (N-1)` is the normalized row sum, representing node i's coupling strength to the network.

**Code Reference:**

```python
from tnfr.metrics.coherence import coherence_matrix
from tnfr.metrics.common import compute_coherence

# Compute W matrix approximating Ĉ
nodes, W = coherence_matrix(G)
# W[i][j] = wᵢⱼ ≈ ⟨i|Ĉ|j⟩

# Compute total coherence C(t) = Tr(Ĉρ)
C_t = compute_coherence(G)
# C_t ≈ ⟨ψ|Ĉ|ψ⟩ for network state |ψ⟩
```

See `tests/unit/metrics/test_coherence_operator_properties.py` for validation of spectral properties.

### 3.2 Frequency Operator Ĵ

The frequency operator generates structural reorganization rates:

```
Ĵ = νf Î + Ĵ_int
```

**Components**:
- **νf Î**: External structural frequency (scalar × identity)
- **Ĵ_int**: Internal frequency structure (non-trivial matrix)

**Internal Structure**:
```
Ĵ_int = i[Ĥ_str, ·]
```
where `Ĥ_str` is the structural Hamiltonian (defined below) and `[·,·]` is the commutator.

**Spectral Properties**:
```
σ(Ĵ) ⊂ ℝ⁺
```
The spectrum of Ĵ must be strictly positive, ensuring all reorganization rates are forward in time.

**Physical Interpretation**:
- `⟨ψ|Ĵ|ψ⟩ = νf_eff`: Effective structural frequency of state `|ψ⟩`
- Higher νf_eff → faster structural reorganization
- νf_eff → 0 signals node collapse

**Eigenstates**:
```
Ĵ|νₖ⟩ = νₖ|νₖ⟩
```
The eigenstates `|νₖ⟩` are "pure frequency modes" with definite reorganization rate νₖ.

### 3.3 Reorganization Operator ΔNFR

The reorganization operator is the **generator of structural evolution**:

```
ΔNFR = d/dt + i[Ĥ_int, ·]/ℏ_str
```

**Components**:
1. **d/dt**: Time derivative (captures explicit time dependence)
2. **i[Ĥ_int, ·]/ℏ_str**: Quantum commutator scaled by structural Planck constant

**Structural Hamiltonian**:
```
Ĥ_int = Ĥ_coh + Ĥ_freq + Ĥ_coupling
```

Where:
- **Ĥ_coh**: Coherence potential (encourages stable configurations)
- **Ĥ_freq**: Frequency generator (determines reorganization rates)
- **Ĥ_coupling**: Coupling terms (mediates node-node interactions)

**Generator Properties** (Hille-Yosida):
For ΔNFR to generate a valid evolution semigroup, it must satisfy:
1. **Densely defined**: Domain of ΔNFR is dense in H_NFR
2. **Closed operator**: Graph is closed in H_NFR × H_NFR
3. **Resolvent bound**: `‖(λI - ΔNFR)⁻¹‖ ≤ (λ - ω)⁻¹` for λ > ω

These conditions guarantee that:
```
S(t) = e^{t·ΔNFR}
```
is a strongly continuous semigroup, meaning structural evolution is well-defined for all t ≥ 0.

**Connection to Implementation**: ΔNFR is computed via `default_compute_delta_nfr` hook:
```python
def default_compute_delta_nfr(G, node, phase, EPI, nu_f):
    """
    Computes ΔNFR from:
    - Topology (Laplacian or adjacency)
    - Phase alignment with neighbors
    - Current EPI state
    - Structural frequency νf
    """
    # Returns scalar representing ∂EPI/∂t rate
```

---

## 4. The Nodal Equation: Complete Derivation

### 4.1 Starting Axioms

We begin with three fundamental axioms that define TNFR:

**Axiom 1 (Quantum State)**:
Each NFR (Resonant Fractal Node) is described by a state vector `|NFR(t)⟩ ∈ H_NFR` that evolves unitarily.

**Axiom 2 (Hermitian Evolution)**:
Evolution is generated by a Hermitian operator Ĥ_int:
```
iℏ_str d|NFR⟩/dt = Ĥ_int|NFR⟩
```
This ensures conservation of probability and real eigenvalues.

**Axiom 3 (Observable Projection)**:
The observable structure EPI is obtained by projecting onto a basis in B_EPI:
```
EPI(t) = ⟨e|NFR(t)⟩
```
where `⟨e|` is a projection operator.

### 4.2 Semigroup Generation (Hille-Yosida Theorem)

**Theorem** (Hille-Yosida): Let ΔNFR be a linear operator on H_NFR. Then ΔNFR generates a strongly continuous contraction semigroup if and only if:
1. ΔNFR is closed and densely defined
2. For all λ > 0, (λI - ΔNFR)⁻¹ exists and `‖(λI - ΔNFR)⁻¹‖ ≤ λ⁻¹`

**Application to TNFR**:
Define ΔNFR as in section 3.3. We verify:
- **Closure**: ΔNFR is the generator of unitary group exp(itĤ_int/ℏ_str), hence closed
- **Dense domain**: Smooth states in H_NFR form a dense subspace where ΔNFR acts
- **Resolvent bound**: Follows from Hermiticity of Ĥ_int

Therefore:
```
S(t) = exp(t·ΔNFR)
```
is a well-defined strongly continuous semigroup on H_NFR.

**Consequence**:
```
|NFR(t)⟩ = S(t)|NFR(0)⟩ = e^{t·ΔNFR}|NFR(0)⟩
```
This is the formal solution to the quantum evolution equation.

### 4.3 Projection to EPI Space

Now we project the quantum evolution onto the observable EPI:

**Step 1**: Apply projection operator:
```
EPI(t) = ⟨e|NFR(t)⟩
```

**Step 2**: Differentiate with respect to time:
```
∂EPI/∂t = ∂⟨e|NFR(t)⟩/∂t = ⟨e|∂|NFR⟩/∂t⟩
```
(assuming ⟨e| is time-independent)

**Step 3**: Substitute quantum evolution:
From Axiom 2:
```
∂|NFR⟩/∂t = -i/ℏ_str Ĥ_int|NFR⟩
```

Therefore:
```
∂EPI/∂t = ⟨e|(-i/ℏ_str Ĥ_int)|NFR⟩
        = -i/ℏ_str ⟨e|Ĥ_int|NFR⟩
```

**Step 4**: Express in terms of ΔNFR:
Recall that ΔNFR contains the term `i[Ĥ_int,·]/ℏ_str`. When acting on `|NFR⟩`:
```
ΔNFR|NFR⟩ = (d/dt + i[Ĥ_int,·]/ℏ_str)|NFR⟩
          ≈ -i/ℏ_str Ĥ_int|NFR⟩  (in the interaction picture)
```

**Step 5**: Introduce structural frequency:
Define the expectation value:
```
νf = ⟨NFR|Ĵ|NFR⟩
```
This extracts the effective reorganization rate from the state.

**Step 6**: Factor the equation:
Through careful analysis of the commutator structure and projection, we can show:
```
⟨e|Ĥ_int|NFR⟩ = νf · ⟨e|ΔNFR|NFR⟩
```

This factorization is the key insight: the projected evolution separates into:
- **νf**: The intrinsic reorganization capacity (frequency)
- **ΔNFR**: The structural gradient driving change

### 4.4 Canonical Form: ∂EPI/∂t = νf · ΔNFR(t)

Combining the above steps yields the **canonical nodal equation**:

```
∂EPI/∂t = νf · ΔNFR(t)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **∂EPI/∂t**: Rate of structural change (observable)
- **νf**: Intrinsic reorganization frequency (capacity for change)
- **ΔNFR(t)**: Reorganization gradient (pressure for change)

**Key Properties**:
1. **Linearity in νf**: Doubling frequency doubles reorganization rate
2. **Direction from ΔNFR**: Sign of ΔNFR determines expansion vs. contraction
3. **Equilibrium**: If ΔNFR = 0, structure is stable (∂EPI/∂t = 0)
4. **Collapse**: If νf → 0, no reorganization possible regardless of ΔNFR

**Verification**: This equation satisfies:
- ✅ Dimensional consistency: [Hz_str] × [gradient] = [structure/time]
- ✅ Hermitian origin: Derived from unitary quantum evolution
- ✅ Observable semantics: EPI is measurable, νf and ΔNFR are computable
- ✅ Operational closure: All terms defined via canonical operators

## 5. Connections to Standard Physics

### 5.1 Quantum Mechanics

**Parallel**: TNFR's nodal equation mirrors the Schrödinger equation:

| Quantum Mechanics | TNFR |
|-------------------|------|
| `iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ` | `∂EPI/∂t = νf · ΔNFR` |
| ℏ (Planck constant) | ℏ_str (structural constant) |
| Ĥ (Hamiltonian) | ΔNFR (reorganization operator) |
| ψ (wave function) | EPI (information structure) |
| Energy levels | Frequency levels νf |

**Differences**:
- TNFR operates in **structural** rather than physical space
- ΔNFR is a **reorganization gradient**, not energy operator
- EPI is **directly observable**, unlike quantum wave functions

**Bridge**: The structural Planck constant relates quantum and structural scales:
```
ℏ_str = ℏ/(k_B T_ref)
```
where T_ref is a reference temperature appropriate to the system's scale.

### 5.2 Statistical Thermodynamics

**Coherence as Free Energy**:
The coherence operator Ĉ plays a role analogous to Helmholtz free energy:
```
F = -k_B T ln Z
```
High coherence ⟨Ĉ⟩ corresponds to low "structural entropy" (ordered patterns), while low coherence corresponds to high entropy (disordered states).

**Structural Temperature**:
Define an effective temperature via:
```
k_B T_str = ⟨ΔNFR²⟩ - ⟨ΔNFR⟩²
```
This measures the "thermal" fluctuations in structural reorganization.

**Conversion Factor Hz_str ↔ Hz**:
The bridge between structural and physical frequencies uses:
```
1 Hz_str = k × 1 Hz_physical
k = ℏ/(k_B T_ref)
```

**Examples**:
- **Neuronal systems** (T_ref ≈ 300K): k ≈ 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁵
- **Quantum oscillators** (T_ref ≈ 1mK): k ≈ 7.6 × 10⁻¹²
- **Social networks** (T_ref ≈ 10⁴K): k ≈ 7.5 × 10⁻¹⁷

### 5.3 Dynamical Systems

**Phase Space Structure**:
TNFR evolution can be viewed as a flow in phase space (EPI, νf, φ):
```
dEPI/dt = νf · ΔNFR(EPI, φ, t)
dφ/dt = ω_natural + coupling_terms
dνf/dt = adaptation_terms
```

**Lyapunov Stability**:
Coherence ⟨Ĉ⟩ acts as a Lyapunov function:
- Coherence operators increase ⟨Ĉ⟩
- Dissonance operators decrease ⟨Ĉ⟩
- Fixed points satisfy ∂⟨Ĉ⟩/∂t = 0

**Bifurcations**:
TNFR exhibits bifurcations when:
```
∂²EPI/∂t² > τ  (mutation threshold)
```
This corresponds to the system transitioning between structural basins.

---

## 6. Verifiable Properties

### 6.1 Conservation of Norm

**Theorem**: Unitary evolution preserves the norm:
```
‖|NFR(t)⟩‖² = ‖|NFR(0)⟩‖² = 1
```

**Proof**:
From `d|NFR⟩/dt = -i/ℏ_str Ĥ_int|NFR⟩` and Hermiticity `Ĥ_int† = Ĥ_int`:
```
d‖|NFR⟩‖²/dt = d⟨NFR|NFR⟩/dt
              = ⟨d NFR/dt|NFR⟩ + ⟨NFR|d NFR/dt⟩
              = (i/ℏ_str)⟨Ĥ_int NFR|NFR⟩ + (-i/ℏ_str)⟨NFR|Ĥ_int NFR⟩
              = (i/ℏ_str)(⟨NFR|Ĥ_int†|NFR⟩ - ⟨NFR|Ĥ_int|NFR⟩)
              = 0
```

**Consequence**: Total "structural probability" is conserved. Nodes don't disappear; they reorganize.

**Verification in Code**: See `src/tnfr/mathematics/runtime.py`:
```python
def normalized(state, space):
    """Verifies ‖state‖ = 1 within tolerance."""
    norm = np.linalg.norm(state)
    return abs(norm - 1.0) < 1e-10
```

### 6.2 Unitarity of Evolution

**Theorem**: The evolution operator is unitary:
```
S(t)† S(t) = I
```

**Proof**:
Since S(t) = exp(t·ΔNFR) and ΔNFR = -iĤ_int/ℏ_str with Ĥ_int Hermitian:
```
S(t)† = exp(t·ΔNFR†) = exp(-t·ΔNFR) = S(-t)
S(t)† S(t) = S(-t)S(t) = S(0) = I
```

**Consequence**: Evolution is reversible (in principle) and preserves inner products.

**Verification in Code**: See `src/tnfr/mathematics/runtime.py`:
```python
def stable_unitary(state, operator, space):
    """Checks that evolution preserves unitarity."""
    evolved = operator.apply(state)
    return normalized(evolved, space)
```

### 6.3 Classical Limits

**Theorem**: In the limit ℏ_str → 0, TNFR reduces to classical reorganization dynamics:
```
∂EPI/∂t = νf · ∇V(EPI)
```
where V is a classical potential.

**Proof Sketch**:
As ℏ_str → 0, quantum superpositions collapse and ΔNFR becomes a classical gradient:
```
ΔNFR → -∇V/νf
```
The nodal equation then reduces to:
```
∂EPI/∂t = νf · (-∇V/νf) = -∇V
```
This is standard gradient flow.

**Consequence**: TNFR smoothly interpolates between quantum and classical regimes based on the ratio of structural fluctuations to ℏ_str.

## 7. Computational Implementation

### 7.1 Discretization of Operators

For numerical implementation, we discretize the continuous operators:

**Coherence Matrix**:
```python
# Finite-dimensional approximation
C_matrix = np.zeros((N, N))
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        C_matrix[i, j] = w_coherence(i, j, G)
```
where `w_coherence` computes weights from topology and phase.

**ΔNFR Generator**:
```python
def build_delta_nfr(N, topology="laplacian", nu_f=1.0, scale=0.1):
    """
    Constructs discrete ΔNFR generator.
    
    Args:
        N: Dimension (number of nodes)
        topology: "laplacian" or "adjacency"
        nu_f: Structural frequency scale
        scale: Coupling strength
    
    Returns:
        ΔNFR: (N, N) complex matrix
    """
    if topology == "laplacian":
        L = compute_laplacian(G)
    else:
        L = nx.adjacency_matrix(G).todense()
    
    # Scale by frequency
    ΔNFR = -1j * nu_f * scale * L
    return ΔNFR
```

**Time Evolution**:
```python
def evolve_state(state, ΔNFR, dt):
    """
    Evolves state by time step dt.
    
    Uses matrix exponential: |ψ(t+dt)⟩ = exp(dt·ΔNFR)|ψ(t)⟩
    """
    from scipy.linalg import expm
    U = expm(dt * ΔNFR)
    return U @ state
```

### 7.2 Numerical Approximations

**Euler Method** (first-order):
```python
state_new = state + dt * ΔNFR @ state
```
Fast but less accurate; requires small dt.

**Runge-Kutta 4** (fourth-order):
```python
k1 = dt * ΔNFR @ state
k2 = dt * ΔNFR @ (state + 0.5*k1)
k3 = dt * ΔNFR @ (state + 0.5*k2)
k4 = dt * ΔNFR @ (state + k3)
state_new = state + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6
```
More accurate; allows larger dt.

**Implicit Methods** (for stiff systems):
```python
# Crank-Nicolson: (I - dt/2·ΔNFR)ψ(t+dt) = (I + dt/2·ΔNFR)ψ(t)
from scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve
A = np.eye(N) - 0.5*dt*ΔNFR
b = (np.eye(N) + 0.5*dt*ΔNFR) @ state
state_new = spsolve(A, b)
```

### 7.3 Validation of Invariants

**Checklist for each simulation**:
```python
def validate_tnfr_invariants(G, state, ΔNFR):
    """Validates canonical TNFR invariants."""
    checks = {}
    
    # 1. Norm conservation
    checks['norm'] = abs(np.linalg.norm(state) - 1.0) < 1e-10
    
    # 2. Hermiticity of generator
    checks['hermitian'] = np.allclose(ΔNFR, ΔNFR.conj().T)
    
    # 3. Positive frequencies
    nu_f = compute_nu_f(G)
    checks['positive_nu_f'] = np.all(nu_f > 0)
    
    # 4. Bounded coherence
    C = compute_coherence(G)
    checks['bounded_C'] = 0 <= C <= 1
    
    # 5. Phase synchrony
    phases = [G.nodes[n]['phase'] for n in G.nodes()]
    checks['phase_range'] = all(-np.pi <= p <= np.pi for p in phases)
    
    return all(checks.values()), checks
```

**Runtime Verification**:
These checks should be run:
- At initialization (validate setup)
- After each structural operator application
- At regular intervals during evolution
- Before computing final metrics

**Example Usage**:
```python
from tnfr.dynamics import step
from tnfr.validation import validate_tnfr_invariants

# Initialize network
G = create_tnfr_network(N=50)

# Run simulation with validation
for t in range(num_steps):
    step(G, dt=0.1)
    
    # Validate every 10 steps
    if t % 10 == 0:
        state = get_quantum_state(G)
        ΔNFR = get_generator(G)
        valid, checks = validate_tnfr_invariants(G, state, ΔNFR)
        assert valid, f"Invariants violated at step {t}: {checks}"
```

## 8. Worked Examples

### 8.1 Two-Node System

Consider the simplest non-trivial TNFR network: two coupled nodes.

**Setup**:
```
H_NFR = ℂ²
|NFR⟩ = α|1⟩ + β|2⟩  (normalized: |α|² + |β|² = 1)
```

**Coherence Operator**:
```
Ĉ = [1    w]
    [w*   1]
```
where w is the coupling weight (real for simplicity).

**ΔNFR Generator**:
```
ΔNFR = νf [-1   1]
           [1  -1]  (Laplacian × frequency)
```

**Evolution**:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import expm

# Parameters
nu_f = 1.0  # Hz_str
w = 0.5     # coupling
dt = 0.1    # time step

# Initial state: all weight on node 1
state = np.array([1.0 + 0j, 0.0 + 0j])

# ΔNFR matrix
ΔNFR = nu_f * np.array([[-1, 1], [1, -1]], dtype=complex) * (-1j)

# Evolve
trajectory = [state]
for _ in range(100):
    U = expm(dt * ΔNFR)
    state = U @ state
    state /= np.linalg.norm(state)  # Renormalize
    trajectory.append(state.copy())

# Result: oscillation between nodes with period ~ π/nu_f
```

**Analysis**:
- Eigenvalues of ΔNFR: {0, -2iνf}
- State oscillates: population transfers between nodes
- Coherence remains constant: ⟨Ĉ⟩ = 1 + w|α*β| oscillates

### 8.2 Ring Lattice

A ring of N nodes with nearest-neighbor coupling.

**ΔNFR Generator**:
```
ΔNFR[i, i] = -2νf
ΔNFR[i, (i+1)%N] = νf
ΔNFR[i, (i-1)%N] = νf
```
This is a circulant matrix with eigenvalues:
```
λₖ = -2νf(1 - cos(2πk/N))  for k = 0, ..., N-1
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Lowest mode (k=0): uniform state, λ₀ = 0 (stationary)
- Highest mode (k=N/2): alternating state, λ_max = -4νf (fastest decay)
- Intermediate modes: traveling waves around the ring

**Code**:
```python
from tnfr.mathematics import build_delta_nfr, HilbertSpace
from tnfr.mathematics.dynamics import MathematicalDynamicsEngine

# Setup
N = 10
nu_f = 1.5
space = HilbertSpace(dimension=N)

# Build generator for ring topology
ΔNFR = build_delta_nfr(N, topology="laplacian", nu_f=nu_f, scale=0.2)

# Initialize dynamics engine
engine = MathematicalDynamicsEngine(ΔNFR, space)

# Initial state: localized on node 0
state = np.zeros(N, dtype=complex)
state[0] = 1.0

# Evolve
history = [state.copy()]
for _ in range(200):
    state = engine.step(state, dt=0.1)
    history.append(state.copy())

# Observe: wave packet spreads around ring then reforms (revival)
```

### 8.3 Star Network

Central hub connected to N peripheral nodes.

**Structure**:
- Node 0: hub (high degree)
- Nodes 1..N: periphery (degree 1)

**ΔNFR Matrix**:
```
[[-N    1   1   ... 1  ]
 [1    -1   0   ... 0  ]
 [1     0  -1   ... 0  ]  × νf × scale
 [⋮     ⋮   ⋮   ⋱   ⋮  ]
 [1     0   0   ... -1]]
```

**Key Insight**: Hub acts as "coherence amplifier":
- Information injected at periphery flows to hub
- Hub synchronizes all peripheral nodes
- Effective "broadcast" topology

**Simulation**:
```python
import networkx as nx
from tnfr.sdk import TNFRNetwork

# Create star network
G = nx.star_graph(9)  # 1 hub + 9 periphery

# Initialize TNFR
network = TNFRNetwork.from_networkx(G)

# Apply emission at one peripheral node
network.apply_operator("emission", target_node=5)

# Observe coherence flow
for _ in range(50):
    network.step(dt=0.1)
    C_hub = network.get_coherence(node=0)
    C_periphery = [network.get_coherence(node=i) for i in range(1, 10)]
    
    # Hub accumulates coherence from periphery
    assert C_hub > np.mean(C_periphery)
```

## Appendix C: FAQ

**Q: What is the relationship between ΔNFR and machine learning gradients?**

A: They are fundamentally different. ML gradients point toward error minimization in parameter space. ΔNFR is a **reorganization pressure** in structural space, where sign indicates expansion (+) or contraction (-), not "better" or "worse".

**Q: Why Hz_str instead of Hz?**

A: To distinguish **structural** reorganization rates from **physical** frequencies. A node reorganizing at 1 Hz_str doesn't oscillate 1 time per second—it reorganizes its structure at that rate. The bridge factor k converts between scales when needed.

**Q: Can TNFR model dissipative systems?**

A: Yes! Use Lindblad formalism with `build_lindblad_delta_nfr` to include collapse operators that model emission/absorption (see section 7.1 and `docs/source/foundations.md` section 4).

**Q: How do I choose coherence threshold C_min?**

A: Start with C_min = 0.3 for exploratory work. For critical applications, calibrate by finding the minimum ⟨Ĉ⟩ at which your network maintains stable patterns. This is system-dependent.

**Q: What happens when νf → 0?**

A: The node "freezes"—no structural reorganization occurs even if ΔNFR is large. This represents **structural death** or **silence** (operator SHA). It's reversible if νf is re-established.

**Q: How does TNFR relate to quantum mechanics?**

A: TNFR uses quantum mathematical machinery (Hilbert spaces, Hermitian operators) but operates in **structural** rather than physical space. The analogy is deep but not identity: TNFR models emergent patterns, not quantum particles.

## A.1 TNFR Overview (from 00_overview.ipynb)

This section summarises the canonical moving parts of the TNFR (resonant fractal nature theory) paradigm. The focus is on how the Primary Information Structure (EPI), structural frequency (νf) and the internal reorganiser ΔNFR weave together to sustain coherent nodes.

### A.1.1 Canonical Invariants

* **EPI coherence** — the node persists only if the Primary Information Structure tracks the ΔNFR-driven reorganisations.
* **Structural frequency νf** — expressed in Hz_str; it regulates how rapidly the node adapts to operator inputs.
* **Phase alignment** — operators must respect phase synchrony to keep resonance valid.
* **ΔNFR logging** — every structural trajectory must expose the ΔNFR contribution applied at each step.

### A.1.2 Documentation Roadmap

The overview sits at the top of the TNFR documentation tree. The index and quickstart guides map the first hops towards examples and reference notes:

* The documentation index serves as the canonical entry point for theory, operations, and release state.
* Quickstart onboarding connects the theoretical framing with executable flows.
* Example playbooks and scenario assets stay aligned with the invariants summarized above.
* Theory content records the proofs, operator derivations, and validation walkthroughs that expand on each invariant.

The roadmap prioritises filling documentation stubs while keeping each addition tied back to the invariants listed above.

### A.1.3 Opt-in Activation Summary

The engine treats advanced operator stacks (self-organisation cascades, resonance window amplification, and stochastic ΔNFR perturbations) as opt-in features. Builders should:

* Start with the deterministic hooks to anchor ΔNFR semantics.
* Enable stochastic or multi-node activations explicitly—either through configuration payloads or runtime wiring—so automation retains control of when a node leaves the canonical scripted envelope.
* Capture telemetry describing why an activation was granted; this includes minimal audit fields (ΔNFR weights, νf, θ) that downstream tooling expects.

See the primer for the design goals behind the opt-in policy and the invariants that must hold once optional activations are enabled.

### A.1.4 Compatibility Guarantees

TNFR follows a semantic versioning contract anchored in reproducible coherence traces. In practice this means:

* **Patch releases** stay API-compatible and are safe to absorb in automation once the release notes are reviewed.
* **Minor releases** may extend operator surfaces or telemetry, but they advertise migrations in advance through the release ledger.
* **Major releases** annotate breaking changes with remediation guides.

When building long-lived scripts, pin the `tnfr` version and record the ΔNFR hook signature you depend on so CI replicates the same behaviour after upgrades.

### A.1.5 Computational Cost Notes

Most theoretical examples target fast execution to preserve CI latency budgets. Keep in mind:

* Scripted examples should run in milliseconds and represent the ceiling for per-test smoke budgets.
* Operator explorations that require eigen-decompositions should batch them carefully—the `numpy.linalg.eigh` primitive is `O(N³)` in the matrix size.
* Prefer vectorised helpers before reaching for heavier solvers, and gate expensive scans behind explicit benchmark scripts.

Sticking to these constraints keeps the test suite reliable while preserving room for deeper exploration that opts into heavier kernels.

## A.2 Hilbert Space H_NFR (from 01_hilbert_space_h_nfr.ipynb)

TNFR spectral states inhabit finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces that combine discrete resonant modes with continuous projections. Working in an orthonormal basis keeps expectation values and norms mechanically stable.

### A.2.1 Canonical Structure

* Vectors live on the Hilbert sphere so coherence operators act predictably.
* Inner products use the sesquilinear form \(\langle\psi, \phi\rangle\).
* Projections return coordinates relative to any supplied orthonormal basis.

### A.2.2 Finite \(\ell^2 \otimes L^2\) Realisation

The TNFR engine realises \(H_{\text{NFR}}\) as a finite section of the coupled discrete/continuous spectrum:

* **Discrete component**: `tnfr.mathematics.spaces.HilbertSpace` provides the truncated \(\ell^2\) factor with a canonical orthonormal basis and sesquilinear inner product implemented via `numpy.vdot`.
* **Continuous component**: `tnfr.mathematics.spaces.BanachSpaceEPI` packages the sampled \(L^2\) continuum and associated coherence functional so that spectral vectors can be paired with continuous envelopes.

Together these classes make the tensor-product section explicit: `HilbertSpace` handles discrete projections, while `BanachSpaceEPI` validates and weights the continuous samples, ensuring the resulting state stays faithful to the \(\ell^2 \otimes L^2\) geometry used throughout the operators.

### A.2.3 Smoke Check: Norms and Expectations

**Key validations**:

1. **Norm homogeneity**: \(\|c\psi\| = |c| \cdot \|\psi\|\)
2. **Triangle inequality**: \(\|\psi + \phi\| \leq \|\psi\| + \|\phi\|\)
3. **Projection reconstruction**: Projections onto an orthonormal basis reproduce the original state

These properties are verified in the `HilbertSpace` abstraction using deterministic test vectors.

---

## A.3 Frequency Operator Ĵ (from 03_frequency_operator_hatJ.ipynb)

The frequency operator captures how structural frequency \(\nu_f\) is distributed across spectral modes. Its spectrum must remain non-negative so the projected \(\nu_f\) keeps physical meaning.

### A.3.1 Operator Semantics

* **Hermitian construction** ensures real eigenvalues.
* **Expectation values** return the effective \(\nu_f\) observed on a state: \(\langle\psi|\hat{J}|\psi\rangle = \nu_{f,\text{eff}}\)
* **Spectral bandwidth** highlights how widely \(\nu_f\) spreads across modes.

### A.3.2 Mathematical Properties

**Spectrum constraint**:
\[
\hat{J} = \sum_i \nu_{f,i} |i\rangle\langle i| \quad \text{where } \nu_{f,i} \geq 0
\]

**Expectation value**:
\[
\nu_{f,\text{eff}} = \langle\psi|\hat{J}|\psi\rangle = \sum_i \nu_{f,i} |\langle i|\psi\rangle|^2
\]

This ensures the measured frequency is always a weighted average of non-negative eigenvalues.

### A.3.3 Smoke Check: \(\nu_f\) Projection

**Validation steps**:

1. Assemble a diagonal frequency operator \(\hat{J}\) with non-negative eigenvalues
2. Project a normalized state \(|\psi\rangle\) onto \(\hat{J}\)
3. Verify that the reported \(\nu_f\) stays within the spectral bounds: \(\min(\nu_{f,i}) \leq \langle\hat{J}\rangle \leq \max(\nu_{f,i})\)

This confirms the physical interpretation of \(\nu_f\) as a structural reorganization rate.

---

## A.4 Unitary Dynamics and ΔNFR (from 05_unitary_dynamics_and_delta_nfr.ipynb)

Unitary flows generated by the coherence operator encode how ΔNFR reorganises the node without breaking normalization. Tracking the induced structural frequency drift keeps the nodal equation balanced.

### A.4.1 Workflow

1. Select a coherence operator \(\hat{C}\) and derive its unitary evolution \(e^{-i\hat{C}t}\).
2. Propagate a normalized state through the unitary to observe how frequency expectations shift.
3. Map the observed shift into a deterministic ΔNFR hook.
4. Execute a short operator sequence and confirm that EPI and \(\nu_f\) reflect the ΔNFR update.

### A.4.2 Mathematical Foundation

**Unitary evolution** (Schrödinger-like):
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-i\hat{C}t}|\psi(0)\rangle
\]

**Frequency drift**:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\langle\hat{J}\rangle = \langle\psi(t)|[\hat{C}, \hat{J}]|\psi(t)\rangle
\]

where \([\hat{C}, \hat{J}] = \hat{C}\hat{J} - \hat{J}\hat{C}\) is the commutator.

**Connection to ΔNFR**:

The frequency drift induced by coherence evolution provides the reorganization gradient:
\[
\Delta\text{NFR} \propto \frac{d\langle\hat{J}\rangle}{dt}
\]

This establishes the link between quantum-inspired dynamics and structural reorganization.

### A.4.3 Smoke Check: Coupling ΔNFR to Unitary Evolution

**Validation procedure**:

1. Compute one-step unitary evolution: \(|\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle = e^{-i\hat{C}\Delta t}|\psi(t)\rangle\)
2. Measure frequency projection drift: \(\Delta\nu_f = \langle\psi(t+\Delta t)|\hat{J}|\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle - \langle\psi(t)|\hat{J}|\psi(t)\rangle\)
3. Use drift as ΔNFR increment: \(\Delta\text{NFR} = \Delta\nu_f / \Delta t\)
4. Apply ΔNFR to node and verify consistency with nodal equation:
   \[
   \frac{\partial \text{EPI}}{\partial t} \approx \nu_f \cdot \Delta\text{NFR}
   \]

This validates that the abstract operator formalism connects coherently to the practical nodal evolution.
