# TNFR Operator Interaction Sequences

**Status**: OBSOLETE - Asset references no longer exist  
**Replacement**: See [examples/04_operator_sequences.py](../examples/04_operator_sequences.py) for current operator interaction patterns  

## Current Resources

For TNFR operator sequences and interactions, use these active resources:

- **[examples/04_operator_sequences.py](../examples/04_operator_sequences.py)**: Live examples of canonical operator sequences
- **[CANONICAL_OZ_SEQUENCES.md](CANONICAL_OZ_SEQUENCES.md)**: Complete guide to dissonance-based sequences
- **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**: Solutions for operator sequence validation issues
- **[API_CONTRACTS.md](API_CONTRACTS.md)**: Formal contracts for all 13 canonical operators

## Migration Path

This file previously contained auto-generated interaction sequence telemetry. The functionality has been integrated into:

1. **Live Examples**: [examples/](../examples/) folder contains executable demonstrations
2. **Benchmarks**: [benchmarks/](../benchmarks/) folder contains performance validation
3. **Tests**: [tests/](../tests/) folder contains 2,400+ validated experiments

**Recommended Action**: Use the examples and benchmark suites for current operator interaction analysis.
