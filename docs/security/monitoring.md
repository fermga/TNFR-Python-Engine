# Security monitoring dashboard

The TNFR engine security discipline aggregates automated signals to catch regressions, vulnerabilities, and deviations in the structural coherence of the codebase. This dashboard distills the artifacts generated by CodeQL, Dependabot, `pip-audit`, and SAST checks (Bandit and Semgrep) and sets a shared review cadence for the team.

## Dashboard sources

| Source | Location | Primary output | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CodeQL | `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` | SARIF (`codeql-*-results`) | Tracks insecure code alerts and patterns that reduce `C(t)` in critical nodes. |
| Dependabot | `/.github/dependabot.yml` | Native GitHub alerts | Detects dependency misalignment and dissonance events triggered by known CVEs. |
| `pip-audit` | `.github/workflows/pip-audit.yml` | JSON (`pip-audit.json`) | Evaluates vulnerabilities in installed packages and their impact on Î½f and the execution phase. |
| Bandit + Semgrep | `.github/workflows/sast-lint.yml` | SARIF (`bandit.sarif`, `semgrep.sarif`) | Identifies risk patterns and records containment decisions within TNFR operators. |

The `security-dashboard.yml` workflow (see below) automatically downloads the available artifacts and consolidates the results in `docs/security/reports/` to streamline periodic reviews.

## Review cadence

- **Weekly (Mondays)**: inspect the report generated by `security-dashboard.yml`, validate dashboard trends, and log corrective actions. This review aligns with the existing CodeQL (`03:00 UTC`) and `pip-audit` (`05:00 UTC`) cron schedules.
- **After every critical alert**: trigger a controlled dissonance session on the affected component, document the resolution, and update the `C(t)` and `Si` metrics when applicable.
- **Monthly**: audit the Dependabot configuration, SAST rule coverage, and the dashboard scope to uphold operator closure and fidelity to TNFR semantics.

## What to expect in the reports repository

1. A Markdown summary with per-tool counts (critical/high/medium/low) and links to the originating Actions runs.
2. References to the SARIF/JSON artifacts downloaded during execution.
3. A minimal trace of when the report was generated (UTC `timestamp`) to maintain structural traceability.

The `docs/security/reports/` directory is reserved for pipeline-generated artifacts; files are stored as GitHub Actions artifacts and distributed through automated notifications (Slack or other configured webhooks).
