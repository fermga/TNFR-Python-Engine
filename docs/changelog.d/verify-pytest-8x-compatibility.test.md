- Verified pytest 8.x compatibility with all testing dependencies (pytest-cov 7.0.0, pytest-xdist 3.8.0, pytest-timeout 2.4.0, pytest-benchmark 5.2.1, hypothesis 6.146.0, hypothesis-networkx 0.3.0).
- Added comprehensive compatibility test suite in `tests/ci/test_pytest_compatibility.py` to verify pytest functionality and detect deprecation warnings.
- Created `docs/TESTING_COMPATIBILITY.md` documenting verified versions, test results, and recommendations for future updates.
- Added `.coverage` to `.gitignore` to prevent build artifacts from being committed.
- Confirmed current version constraints in `pyproject.toml` are optimal and already support pytest 8.x - no changes required.
