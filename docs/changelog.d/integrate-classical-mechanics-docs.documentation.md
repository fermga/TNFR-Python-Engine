Add comprehensive N-body classical mechanics documentation (`docs/TNFR_CLASSICAL_NBODY.md`) establishing formal correspondence between TNFR structural dynamics and classical mechanics. Includes:
- Complete variable mappings (EPI, νf, ΔNFR → position, mass, force, energy)
- Mathematical derivations summary from foundational theory
- Conservation laws from network symmetries (Noether's theorem)
- Numerical protocols with reproducibility requirements
- Dynamical regime classification (chaos, bifurcations, collective modes)
- Practical code examples with validation criteria
- Cross-references to all theoretical foundations and implementation scripts
