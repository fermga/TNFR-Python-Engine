# TNFR Testing Guide

This page owns local validation instructions. [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
defines tools and dependencies; [the workflow guide](.github/WORKFLOWS.md) owns
CI behavior. Expected mathematics and contracts follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
and the source being tested. A passing test establishes its asserted behavior
and domain, not a general physical theorem.

## Run the repository tests

Run commands from the repository root with the interpreter of a separate
environment. Install the editable project and the dependency groups used by
the main CI test job:

```sh
python -m pip install -e ".[test,numpy,yaml,orjson]"
python -m pytest
```

`test` is the compatibility alias for `test-all`; NumPy is already a core
dependency. There are no `dev` or `all` extras. Smaller extras such as
`test-unit` install only their declared tools and may not support collection
of the whole repository.
Aggregate extras reference the smaller groups so their dependency bounds have
one owner; the compatibility alias does not maintain another dependency list.

The default configuration sets `pythonpath = ["src"]`, `testpaths = ["tests"]`
and `addopts = "-m 'not slow'"`. Pytest imports the working source tree and
excludes tests marked slow. It does not enable strict markers, benchmark skipping
or short tracebacks automatically.

Local execution is serial by default. To use the main CI scheduling policy,
run `python -m pytest -n 2 --dist loadfile`; this keeps the same `not slow`
selection and assertions. Each file stays on one worker to reuse its module
fixtures. Workers isolate Python state and prepare session fixtures independently.
Pytest-benchmark does not collect timing measurements
under xdist; performance measurements need a separate serial run.

Choose an affected directory, module or test for bounded validation:

```sh
python -m pytest tests/core_physics -q
python -m pytest tests/operators/test_u3_hard_invariant.py -q
python -m pytest tests/sdk -q
python -m pytest tests/cli -q
python -m pytest tests/sdk --collect-only -q
```

To include slow tests, use `python -m pytest -o addopts=""` with intended paths.
To select only marked slow tests, use `python -m pytest -m slow` with those
paths. Inspect `python -m pytest --markers` and collection before treating
a marker-selected run as coverage: a registered marker can select no tests.

Standalone scripts do not inherit pytest's source-path configuration. Use the
editable installation above or explicitly set the shell's `PYTHONPATH` to
`src` so a previously installed release cannot replace the working source.

## Organization

[tests/](tests/) contains top-level modules and subject directories. Search for
the affected API rather than maintaining another inventory of individual tests.
Core nodal behavior is in [core_physics/](tests/core_physics/), operators in
[operators/](tests/operators/), specialized certificates in
[physics/](tests/physics/) and public network usage in [sdk/](tests/sdk/).
[CLI integration](tests/cli/) checks the same study recipe through Python and
the module entry point, including malformed input, diagnostic availability,
output replacement and logging isolation. Catalog checks do not execute a study.
[conftest.py](tests/conftest.py) and [utils.py](tests/utils.py) own shared helpers.
The [core scope map](tests/core_physics/README.md) identifies the engine tests
that replace retired self-contained illustrations.

The separately packaged arithmetic applications have their own test paths:

```sh
python -m pytest factorization-lab/tests -q
python -m pytest factorization-lab/benchmarks/test_benchmark_suite.py -q
python -m pytest primality-test/tests -q
```

Run these as separate invocations: their local import roots differ from the core
suite. The root default selection does not include them. See the corresponding
[factorization guide](factorization-lab/README.md) and
[primality guide](primality-test/README.md) for application setup and scope.

Research producers under [benchmarks/](benchmarks/README.md) have declared entry
points and provenance requirements; a default pytest run does not implicitly
cover them. Do not regenerate retained evidence for an unrelated change.

For examples with `run_protocol` and `build_report`, reuse the real report through
a module fixture for numerical and scope checks. The shared
[example helper](tests/example_protocol_helpers.py) checks `main` separately with
a sentinel protocol and synthetic report, without rerunning a scientific producer.
[Runtime facade tests](tests/physics/test_runtime_facade_imports.py) own the two
cold import orders for the P2/REMESH example families; those checks still use
fresh processes and resolve the actual public APIs.

The [Makefile](Makefile) target `make test` uses the configured pytest selection;
`make dev-test` adds coverage over `src`, including compatibility shims. Research
producers run through their explicit targets, such as `make riemann-benchmark`.
`make validate` checks importability, references, documentation integrity and
SDK tests.

## Structural regression evidence

Assert the contract of the changed path. Record representation, graph/support,
coefficients, primitive triad, input history, step size and operator sequence as
relevant. An operator jump and a continuous solver step need different expected
results. For a full grammar word, verify initiation, closure and contextual
admission; distinguish fragments explicitly.

Do not assume all operators increase coherence or that SHA freezes every later
EPI update. Its capacity attenuation, pure-EPI diffusion and a multichannel
trajectory have different scopes. Inspect the
[operator contracts](src/tnfr/operators/operator_contracts.py) and
[grammar scope](theory/DIAGNOSTIC_AND_GRAMMAR_SCOPE.md) before asserting an invariant.
Initialization may set fixture state directly; test subsequent evolution through
the API under review.

When stochastic behavior changes, control the RNG and record its seed, initial
state and execution order. A seed alone does not fix timestamps, external data
or every backend. When relevant, compare available tetrad fields with estimator
provenance and unavailable-field reasons. Diagnostic scores are not acceptance
thresholds unless that specific policy is being tested.

## Backends and optional dependencies

[tests/conftest.py](tests/conftest.py) accepts `--math-backend` and
`TNFR_TEST_MATH_BACKEND`. The command-line option takes precedence; the
selected value sets `TNFR_MATH_BACKEND` and clears the backend cache before
collection.

```sh
python -m pytest tests/mathematics/test_backends.py --math-backend=numpy -q -rs
```

Install `compute-jax` or `compute-torch` before requesting those optional
adapters. Explicit per-test backend requests are not replaced by the session
setting. Review skip reasons with `-rs` and report adapters actually exercised.
NumPy is required by the shared conftest; a missing installation is not evidence
of successful NumPy-free execution.

## Code quality and documentation checks

Install tools needed for the check; options are configured in
[pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml):

```sh
python -m pip install -e ".[dev-minimal,test-quality,typecheck]"
python -m black --check src/tnfr
python -m flake8 src/tnfr
python -m pydocstyle src/tnfr
python -m mypy src/tnfr
python -m pyright src/tnfr
```

Pass affected files for a focused edit where supported. Black and isort use
88 columns; pydocstyle uses NumPy conventions. CI's advisory checks are listed
in [the workflow guide](.github/WORKFLOWS.md). `make format` modifies files;
it is not a read-only validation step.

Optional pre-commit setup requires installing `pre-commit` separately before
`pre-commit install`. [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml)
includes local Bash hooks, so Windows needs Bash available to those hooks. The
local code-review hook prints a reminder; it does not perform a review.

For Markdown-only changes, use the relevant reference check. For site or
documentation-infrastructure changes, also run integrity and build checks:

```sh
python scripts/verify_internal_references.py --ci
python scripts/check_documentation.py
python -m pip install -e ".[docs]"
python scripts/prepare_docs.py
python -m mkdocs build --strict
```

The reference checker accepts `--dirs` followed by files or directories to
bound the check. The staging script copies repository owners into the generated
site; edit those owners rather than generated copies.

## Security checks

Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting and trust boundaries:

```sh
python -m pip install -e ".[security]"
python -m pip_audit
python -m bandit -r src -c bandit.yaml
```

The dependency audit covers installed packages, including extras actually
installed; it does not automatically cover every optional dependency. Bandit's
configured exception is recorded in [bandit.yaml](bandit.yaml). A clean report
does not guarantee that dependencies or code contain no vulnerabilities.

## Validation workflow and reporting

1. Identify the affected contract and existing owners. Reproduce a suspected bug
   before the fix when feasible; distinguish a new counterexample from a measured
   baseline.
2. Add meaningful regression coverage when behavior or an important boundary
   changes. A small documentation correction need not add numerical tests.
3. Run affected checks. Broaden to dependents, optional backends or the default
   suite when changed scope or a failure justifies it. Do not rerun unrelated
   expensive research producers as a routine checklist item.
4. Report actual commands, interpreter and relevant dependency versions,
   pass/fail/skip counts, warnings and untested scope. Do not label a failure
   pre-existing without baseline evidence.

The `structural_rng` fixture supplies NumPy's generator with seed zero.
`structural_tolerances` supplies atol=1e-12 and rtol=1e-10; these are not
exact-theorem eligibility gates. Choose scale-appropriate numerical tolerances
and keep them distinct from represented exact equality. The autouse cleanup
resets selected global state; restore additional state your test changes.

Coverage is feedback, not proof of a physical invariant. With test dependencies
installed, a selected run can generate a report:

```sh
python -m pytest tests/sdk --cov=tnfr --cov-report=term-missing
```

The current project configuration does not enforce a coverage percentage.
The Python 3.11 CI job instead uses `--cov=src` to retain the whole source-directory
scope, with `-n 2 --dist loadfile`. Pytest-cov combines the workers' data and
produces terminal and XML reports. Do not wrap distributed pytest with
`coverage run`: that alone measures the controller instead of combining worker
execution. Coverage of Python subprocesses launched inside tests is a separate
configuration and is not enabled here.

## Retained C6 campaign reproduction

The union/history report tests that reconstruct the retained B54/B55 lineage
are marked `slow`, including tests whose shared fixtures perform that work.
During the 2026-09-19 release check, one union-report fixture consumed more
than 20 minutes of CPU time. This observed cost is not a runtime ceiling.
Lightweight lineage and output-overwrite rejection tests remain in the default
suite; the finite-state union oracles run independently of the retained campaign.

Select the expensive report checks explicitly:

```sh
python -m pytest -m slow tests/physics/test_c6_winding_union_report.py tests/physics/test_c6_winding_history_report.py -q
```

For the independent small-state controls:

```sh
python -m pytest tests/physics/test_c6_carried_return_unions.py -q
```

This classification changes selection by cost, not assertions or scientific
scope. Report the expensive campaign as unrun when omitted, and retain failures
from earlier attempts. A passing reduced suite does not certify the historical
report or close C6 global stability.
