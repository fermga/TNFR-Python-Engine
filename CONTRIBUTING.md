# Contributing

This project uses English exclusively for code identifiers and docstrings. When contributing:

- Use descriptive English names for all variables, functions, classes and modules.
- Write docstrings and comments in English.
- Update existing code to maintain this convention when modifying files.

Please run the test suite with `pytest` before submitting a pull request.
Make sure to honor the patterns in `.gitignore` so that dependency and build
artifacts (e.g., `node_modules/` or `dist/`) are not committed.
