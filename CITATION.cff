abstract: >-
  Canonical computational implementation of TNFR - a paradigm shift from 
  modeling 'things' to modeling coherent patterns that persist through resonance. 
  This Python package provides the complete TNFR physics engine including the 
  13 structural operators, unified grammar validation (U1-U6), and the four 
  canonical structural fields (Φ_s, |∇φ|, K_φ, ξ_C).
